        "raw_text": "hello everyone yep it is working very good hey it's an absolute pleasure to be here today and yes I am going to be talking today about SEO obviously H as well as how to do it in the cloud now just quick disclaimer uh it will go fast uh no wor there will be notes after if you want to contact me and uh very simple uh this is not everything this is just a touch of what can go wrong among others and some things I hope that you have not thought about that you will now have to check on Monday morning when you're back in the office so a couple of things that we'll be aiming at is of course improving uh crawling for BTS as well as uh the indexing process as well as speed for your website now with that we hope of course that we also improve your rankings as well as in the end your turn out for sales now here comes a big question what's the problem right um first of all Google has publicly said that they approximate about 60% of the web is duplicate that is a big big number and with that we are unintentionally playing a tug of war with our own content and that's a problem when we have Cloud Solutions now you might be going like what the hell is he talking about yeah sure um it all starts with the URL now everyone knows how Ur is scheduled or sorry build up at least I'm hoping here that you guys do because this is a technical SEO conference you should know this part um but yeah we have the basics you know like Hello uh we contact uh we access a URL we have an HP request then we get a response and we get status codes now for SEO the two most relevant uh status codes are of course the 200 and the 404 I'm putting the 410 with the 404 because Google kind of sees them as the same now you might be asking about how about the tri ones right aren't they well actually no yes and no they kind of our hack they're are workaround they're not really URL because it's like moving house and Burning Down The House where you were yeah where you previous lived so it's kind of a hack to get to the new place um and it's important to keep that in mind because every change to our URL we see as a change is actually a side move from one to the other and it's important to keep in mind that URLs are immutable so in other words once you create them the only other thing you can do is delete them that's where that four or four status code come in yeah now how do we see URLs or how should we see URLs we we should see URLs as database row IDs so when you work with databases I hope some of you kind of do uh you may know you put a row in the database you may change the data on that row but the one field you never change is the ID you create the ID you delete the row you delete the ID that's it URLs are similar yeah that's an important concept that a lot of people don't think about and the reason why I'm mentioning it is also here Google uses that ID to in the URL inspection tool as the ID this is why on top of search console it's not anything else but the full URL because that's the identifier yeah now John muu said this a few years ago very aply I must honestly say he's not the first one to say not the last one to say the whole internet is based on this concept on the worldwide web at least uh one eurl uh per piece of content a URL is an identifier for that piece of content I really want you guys to keep that in the back of your mind going forward because I come across too many esos that don't realize that yeah and we see too much duplication because of that way too much duplication and this impacts our content signals which if you look at all the updates that Google has pushed in the last few years or actually the last decade plus a lot of them are content quality related so that comes back to this yeah now let's uh talk about how to get this right because this is the meat of the thing this is what we really care for so one very quickly we need to know our host names now of course we can go to Google Search console add our uh domain as a uh as a domain property and maybe see some of the host names that Google is crawling some of the subdomains now you may have done that you may have not done that I hope you have because you may see subdomains there that you did not know that Google was crawling yeah big by the way gives you that data to a certain extent as well in the in the site Explorer but you also want to look at your name server and double check that see what's going on there do you have C names do you have a records do you have duple a records double check that um look for duplication here we want to for example look for staging and depth development uh situations here is Walmart with two simple staging subdomains I'm not sure the IT team is happy that this is out and the SEO team most definitely should not be happy that this is public and indexable yeah um now note that I said earlier know your host name but I did not say know your subdomains yeah very important distinction why because it's not about stuff on your domain only with Cloud Solutions we're actually now talking off domain as well yeah and here simple example uh two examples actually of two websites that have a the first one is development website and the other one is a staging website now and the first one is a bank now if we go to the original website of the bank we can actually see that both the development and the and the original website are returning to status code they're both indexed great do you think that's competing do you think it's safe for users to go to the wp engine version and log in there yeah see see the issues here yeah this is in the cloud and now it's not just for security it's also for competing content we want to limit that duplication part now second we also need to know which URLs Bots are accessing on our website now of course we have craw stats and yes we can see there a little bit at least um Jory will talk about this more later but we can see uh what type of BS are being accessed um from Google and what the status codes are the more interesting parts for me though is this particular one uh this table where we can see by file type if you look at the first one and for the ones in the back that can't see it this is 80% 87% of in of HTML files the other one is 16 yeah the majority of the content that is indexable is on HTML meaning that in this case 51% on the other case is basically wasted craw budget that's something we want to be aware of now the problem is that uh oh yeah and you can also use of course the other reports like this one you might see some interesting data there the important the the problem is that this is just sample data this is not the full picture we do need the full picture to make better decisions so then we need to go to our server logs and we need to ask ourselves are we recording the right data because very often we're not and double check that with your it team um here's a simplified version of a part common log file format the user agent for condensity purposes I've taken off but everything else should be there in principle and we can see the Slash and we can see a 200 status code right now here we have the next line or a few lines down and we see again the Slash the root and the 301 what's going on here why do we have two different status codes for the same slash for the root right this can happen in our log files well the reason is because one is the https on the root and the other one is the HTTP but we did not record that distinction in our log file so now we don't know we also didn't know if this was maybe the www yeah versus The Naked domain so these are things that you need to record and the standard log files do not record that so make sure that you include the origin of every URL that uh you record in your log files so in other words the full absolute URL you need to be able to reconstruct it I don't care if you file it as a separate field or as the full you absolute URL but get the data because otherwise you don't have the data as simple as that you may think you have but you don't also collect all of it because if you work in techn SEO especially with Cloud Solutions how about the CDN how about the low balancer do you have those log files too you need to because the the the user might actually never reach your server and you still need that request same for Google bot yeah you need to get that data um and if you don't or if you don't record all the relevant data um it's like playing go when half the board is invisible to you yeah you're not going to be able to good to make good business decision or SEO strategy decisions going forward you have impartial data uh or partial data I should actually say not impartial partial now number three another problem I often see is uh blocking Bots with firewalls uh see a lot of sites that are aggressively proactively blocking Bots and with that um yeah you do need to double check that you're not accidentally accidentally blocking Google bot because uh if even these B protection services that are being sold out there they don't get it right yeah not always so you may be accidentally blocking Google B which is something that Google Bol has also complained about um now some of that might show up here in in this particular report saying like hey uh we can't reach your pce because it's blocked but it's not the only reason why might pop up here so keep in mind it's not the final solution or the final answer but it may give you an indication now you do might know that Google gole also publishes uh the IP addresses that they crawl from right and we can use those uh to Whit list great Whit list however they are being updated regularly so uh as a result you need to make sure that the IT team updates them regularly otherwise again you're blocking and you need to do the moment that they actually update it yeah that's another thing but also if you do any log parsing or compar and and Analysis later on on log files from a year ago that list May be updated and IP addresses may have been removed because that happens too and so now a log log entry from a year ago you may not a be able to verify because the IP address isn't being used anymore unless you have historic data for that IP address so you can use tools like this now the better approach when you do work with firewalls and an overly aggressive it team uh on blocking Bots uh first allow the Bots set a threshold once you have a certain threshold verify if you should block the bot like this could be like a th000 qu requests an hour or week or whatever yeah talk about what is reasonable and at that point block if needed but take a reactive approach rather than a proactive approach yeah now another topic on the other side now we had talked about Bots we also have the other side are you human yeah and you may have seen these type of screens where like hey are you a human and Google has complained about that too because they also cause a problem for SEO for example they generate these Infinite Space of URLs on your domain especially when you use services like Cloud flare because in their situation they basically take over your domain on name server level and they just append it to the path and you don't you don't have control at that point now um also the responses that we're giving may not be actually content but there 200 status code so again something that Google has complained about if you use cloud F Services make sure that you have this line on your robot of txt even if you do not uh use the challenge uh feature of like are you a bot or not just have it because if one of your organization in your organization enables it you want to have it there from day one yeah so it's a simple line added if you use cloud flare as a simple example and they also say so please add this so it's nothing too new but a lot of people don't um if you use cloud storage also fun fun thing uh to use cloud storage we can for example use AWS uh as three buckets here the first one is NASA uh page if you look at the NASA page the actual NASA page is also live on nasa.gov and they're basically identical D well they're basically duplicat the the the thing is it's NASA they did not add a canonical yeah um yes that happens um now but that's not the only place we Al also can find these storage buckets for example at Google no it's not limit or digital spaces from digital Ocean or whatever there's a whole bunch of these type of Pockets out there where we have duplicates of our content yeah uh low balances is another example uh here two examples of low balances um great right on Google user content.com if you run containerized apps or serverless apps you may have it also for example if you running Google Cloud on Google run you may have a run. apppp subdomain yeah and again with all your stuff duplicated uh if you Outsource uh here's a WP engine example I don't know if you guys can see it but the top is basically Pages all index alternate page with proper uh canonical tag and the bottom is the user declared is the root domain what however is happening the root domain is not being served as primary instead the wp engine subdomain is rendered as the primary despite the root being mentioned also even in the sitemap yeah cdns similar story can happen there too here's MOS with most of their Pages duplicated yes it also happens to us seos yeah but no not the only ones Master Class similar story photo deck similar story if we look there again 200 status codes on both SES um if we also look at some of the bigger guys gold Goldman sex similar story duplicated even there we can find they have a canonical in place still it's indexed meaning chonicles don't always work it's a suggestion you can't rely on them yeah and especially with this type of duplicate duplic content issue you really cannot so keep that in mind now one of those things also happened to me obviously which is one of the reasons why I made this deck in the first place this happened to me in the last few years a few times I do develop a lot of apps and stuff like that I containerized them normally I launch them in the cloud I put them on Google run and I want often also uh things to run fast so it also a low balancer as well as CD use the Google CDN Network now with that I know I have to put up a redirect straight off because if the host name has that run. app thing I wanted to redirect it to the main domain yeah so I do that first so bum I put a redirect on I detect the host name if it contains uh run. app if it ends on that then I redirected to the main domain leave the path intact um so it's basically Tre on deep redirect and I do all the usual checks on my side everything is fine yeah on my main domain I check basic tools all the tools you can think of J octopus deep Lumar or enro or whatever you know screaming fog it all works fine of course that things to optimize but overall no alarm Bells go off and then I got this email 500 and I get this really weird Euro and I'll blow it out a little bit it's this one really weird HP public AC 01 ac01 C gcp e D3 Etc I'm like wait yeah okay so I look a little bit deeper I see gcp Google Cloud platform reference then I see with with someone else who has the same problem as me doesn't know it uh they there I also see a reference to open caching so I now have to look into open caching and yes there's a protocol open caching protocol that distributes content to open cdns like with ISP Etc so now I have to add another line to my reader now I know this works because after I do I start getting email alerts that yeah the link has been removed it's now a 301 great at least that worked so I'm thinking okay I'm good right let's look at the back links nope now I see there Google user content.com popping up in my backlinks in Google search console so I'm like what's going on so yeah my content is duplicated again somewhere else on another on another subdomain and I'm like seriously uh yeah so I have to add that now too to my list um now think that's it nope I know that is the IP oh sorry that was the low balancer so if you look here there's an IP address in Reverse so I go to the IP address and yep guess what my website is also accessible there so again I have to add another line to my redirects um you know now then I'm like okay let's look into what's going on so I go to the low balancer website and then dive into the sitemap what do I find the whole sitemap the host names have been Rewritten from my normal domain to guess what the load balancer host name that's why Google's indexing it all yeah so I'm like seriously no so I try to fix it and while I'm doing that I can get this email from Yandex who says yeah your canonical has changed to this weird appspot.com thing I'm like seriously what is going on yeah so it turns out if you're on the same network uh Google proxies and especially some of those Russian ones uh they can basically overtake the host name part within the Google Cloud Network apparently I don't know uh but somehow it reseted my my canonical now so I'm not only canonical are off the side mats are off my content is being duplicated all over the place I'm like seriously what's going on so I haven't even talked about the fact that I also still have to uh add the www by the way so I try to basically look at yes I had to add it too um basically look at what's the cost so I launch my app in Python with flash with workor and I find out the URL 4 function tries to detect the host name based on the environmental settings normally that works but in Cloud environments it's a little bit trickier and if you think this is just python no this all applies to all those languages and this is just a few few of them so this is not isolated yeah it really depends on every single one what they fill out with um so yeah I'm I have this I need to add the www as well I'm like this getting enough I don't want to do exception after exception exception so I do the other way around I have to now hard code my domain in my code to basically say if it doesn't match that it must be one of the other ones so then redirect yeah now that's of course not great but now I have to hard code domains uh which goes a little bit against the whole dockerized thing but yeah anyway um some considerations if you have this type of problem as well is you want to prevent indexation of this dupli content of course redirect when you can disallow with robot txt if you can't be mindful that you should actually always have a robot at txt because not everyone does for example here's um I'm just going to go ahead if you want to test your robots txt check also with Google but here's the key thing so if you have a bucket if you have your stuff in a bucket and you do not have a robot of txt there you may get something like a 4 or3 or 4 or4 as for for the robots of txt file in your Shain bucket yeah that means crawl everything so if your site has a robot at txt but does not have that in the bucket but is duplicated in the bucket so the things that you have excluded on your domain are now fully crawlable from your bucket so the things you don't want to yeah so be mindful keep in mind robot txd also needs to be in that bucket now also uh keep in mind inheritance because not every bucket is on the subdomain meaning in this case it's on the subdirectory so I've seen people trying to block with Robos txd in the sub but that doesn't work yeah you do need uh it on the root of the origin and in that case we're back to the root of the origin that Google controls which is a 44 crawl everything not great Idol right so be mindful there which type of bucket you have um you also want to disable directory listings because people you know can go in there and there are these grayhead tools that are trying to basically expose every bucket that's out there so not only search engines it's also for security purposes disable these things uh and utilize no index if all the other things fail yeah but specifically for the bucket of course because you don't want know index your website be mindful with canonical there to not use it at the same time also one other thing I don't ever almost see anyone do is add their bucket or the CDN um thing like cloudfront Etc to Google search console you can add it as a uh URL prefix and see what's going on there yeah um and set up alerts make sure you have a bunch of alerts that alert you on these things because this is off domain so link alerts and 500 errors I every every 500 error that's generated on any of my websites I get an email that's how I found it initially yeah so these things yes I got hundreds of emails but that's a different problem that is a problem I can solve and I I rather know about it than not know about it you know what I mean so this is one of those things and it depend on your text what you can and cannot do but by all means use all of these link detection things and whatever alerts to to basically see what you uh can do there and now just a quick bonus to add because I do like also processing backhands and I think we can do better there and Rick talked about a little bit but uh the key thing is we want to speed websites up and for that reason we want to make sure that our network is fast so we can look at se console and we can see for example this is not stable yeah this is not a stable connection um we also want to reduce latency which is one of the reasons why I launch most of my apps in Google Cloud because it's closer to Google bot another reason to put it there yeah um time to First buite Rick talked about this morning most definitely something in case you're wondering this is too slow yeah this is better so uh just FYI um if you are going serverless also keep in mind that you want to look at the instances you running and because starting up a new instance is a cold start and even if you have a fast boot uh it takes time now and just as an example I have here bilding like a instance running minimum instance running and being built for that I turn that off and basically did on user request it killed my time to first bite at the end there yeah it just took more time to boot up all the time so you always need to have one running minimum if not two yeah um also make sure you use the latest security things like TLS htps uh because they allow you to do some fun stuff with the network I'm not going to go into detail of that I'm sure that you guys can read the documentation be mindful though when you are using compressions um that um uh you use also the same one as your CDN uh because I have seen and I've also experienced even firsthand issues where I was using broadly but CDN couldn't support broadly they only use gzip so now uh there was a mismatch in encoding and that actually was uh causing rendering issues in the browser yeah so be mindful there too uh server resources we're talking here about CPU RAM and disk this is something you really want to optimize as well and go a little bit more than you need to here's an example where I basically uh went to the next level in the standard lifts and it made a huge difference just making that switch that's it nothing more yeah um make sure you have enough resources now of course all of this time to First buy Rick talked about morning a lot of this stuff uh can improve the other web vitals too but I also like to look at from the other direction with web vitals and to look at which websites are fast and how are their we basically based on the web vitals which websites have good web vitals and which Technologies are they then using yeah so the other way around and um the Crux team have a report I heard from Rick this morning they are bettering or they are working on the better with a new interface so new stuff com up um but key thing here uh when we look for example at server software um here's the operating systems we can see Debian and FreeBSD doing a lot better ubun does not windows in the middle no big surprise there um but yeah the the you know this can be a consideration when you are considering changing your TX stack yeah you can look at these things is this something that might be better for us uh same when it comes to the type of server uh the HTTP servers it's all over the place but if few jump out and some also in the negative way so maybe that's something to consider um also where you want to identify other bottlenecks like for example the distance to the user of course which cloud provider do you use again there's a whole bunch of them if you take the top known ones here uh we can see two really jump out and nether one or AWS or Zuri yeah and yeah that might be because of that may also not be might be other reasons but this is a consideration this is something to keep in mind when you using the next time uh which language you program your website is python is most definitely not the fastest it's the easiest not the fastest everyone faster may want to use another one yeah and we can also see again which uh sites are faster we're using which language that this is of course assuming that uh this is all correctly detected it's from a sample data set yeah keep that in mind and when we use inmemory or disc caching is also a technique that we can use in the back end really well and here's an example of one of my websites where I implemented it from not to implementing both of them at the same time and it made a huge difference um keep that in mind when we're talking about cashable resources every page should be cashable one of the biggest mistakes that I see uh website owners do is use a CDN and then use a cash control of no store which completely defeats the purpose of using a CDN yeah because every request has to still go to the origin so make sure all your resources are cashable and if they're cashable that also means that you can do a lot more with SEO in the right way so that's cool so by all means you can also even have your own Edge server it does not need to be a known CDN uh if you look here for example it's all over the place so let's take the top three and then we can see Farish Farish your own implementation yeah can be just as fast as any of those Cloud Solutions yeah keep that in mind when we have a database um again might better it might be consideration to see which database is faster for you now keep in mind doesn't stop there we also need to look at the latency of our queries for example are we executing uh complex queries like joints Etc uh what type of data format do we have how do we store the data SQL no SQL you know all of this kind of stuff how many queries do we need to send here's a simple hello world installation on WordPress 18 queries through the database hello world 18 queries well though 2,000 plus hooks what really I can do a static side that's faster than that come on why do we need this well it's because of these type of things in the template most of this stuff is static it never changes it changes on day one and that's it why don't we make these Global variables instead yeah save all of those database queries simple things like that um when you have assets uh a lot of people say like yeah just Rend them from a bucket that has its advantages um we can use maybe a bucket but I'm not ecstatic about it I haven't seen many websites that actually perform well with that and this also tells me nothing pretty much almost nothing gets about 40% here so with some exceptions at some points I'm not really excitic about that option you need to test what works for you now of course you can use the server header server timing to record these things in the back end and send that along with the HTTP request or response basically to this uh uh user and grab it with your analytics and basically grab this data and you can see what is really the bottleneck in the back of your uh back end now where you do that and you fix those things you will see your call requests go up because that's what Google wants to see as well yeah they will crawl your website more now uh quick takeaways um content quality issues we have a lot of them especially in the cloud um we need to audit this regularly and keep in mind don't limit your ERS to just the domain check outside that especially when there are things happening like low balances CDN and whatever uh tackle these issues then find a solution for it um avoid the duplication and optimize the back end please yeah no one wants to be in this situation so uh my name is Philly I'm an ex Google engineer and if you have any questions I'll be around and if you want a copy of the slide deck you can either reach me on philly.com or SAR brother. come thank you very much",

but yeah we have the basics you know like hello uh we contact uh we access a url we have an hp request then we get a response and we get status codes now for seo the two most relevant uh status codes are of course the 200 and the 404 im putting the 410 with the 404 because google kind of sees them as the same now you might be asking about how about the tri ones right arent they well actually no yes and no they kind of our hack theyre are workaround theyre not really url because its like moving house and burning down the house where you were yeah where you previous lived so its kind of a hack to get to the new place um and its important to keep that in mind because every change to our url we see as a change is actually a side move from one to the other and its important to keep in mind that urls are immutable so in other words once you create them the only other thing you can do is delete them thats where that four or four status code come in yeah now how do we see urls or how

across too many esos that dont realize that yeah and we see too much duplication because of that way too much duplication and this impacts our content signals which if you look at all the updates that google has pushed in the last few years or actually the last decade plus a lot of them are content quality related so that comes back to this yeah now lets uh talk about how to get this right because this is the meat of the thing this is what we really care for so one very quickly we need to know our host names now of course we can go to google search console add our uh domain as a uh as a domain

depth development uh situations here is walmart with two simple staging subdomains im not sure the it team is happy that this is out and the seo team most definitely should not be happy that this is public and indexable yeah um now note that i said earlier know your host name but i did not say know your subdomains yeah very important distinction why because its not about stuff on your domain only with cloud solutions were actually now talking off domain as well yeah and here simple example uh two examples actually of two websites that have a the first one is development website and the other one is a staging website now and the first one is a bank now if we go to the original website of the bank we can actually see that both the development and the and the original website are returning

of in of html files the other one is 16 yeah the majority of the content that is indexable is on html meaning that in this case 51 on the other case is basically wasted craw budget thats something we

this is just sample data this is not the full picture we do need the full picture to make better decisions so then we need to go to our server logs and we need to ask ourselves are we recording the right data because very often were not and double check that with your it team um heres a simplified version of a part common log file format the user agent for condensity purposes ive taken off but everything else should be there in principle and we can see the slash and we can see a 200 status code right now here we have the next line or a few lines down and we see again the slash the root and the 301 whats going on here why do we have two different status codes for the same slash for the root right this can happen in our log files well the reason is because one is the https on the root and the other one is the http but we did not record that distinction in our log file so now we dont know we also didnt know if this was maybe the www yeah versus the naked domain so these are things that you need to record and the standard log files do not record that so make sure that you include the origin of every url that uh you record in your log files so in other words the full absolute url you need to be able to reconstruct it i dont care if you file it as a separate field or as the full you absolute url but get the data because otherwise you dont have the data as simple as that you may think you have but you dont also collect all of it because if you work in techn seo especially with cloud solutions how about the cdn how about the low balancer do you have those log files too you need to because the the the user might actually never reach your server and you still need that request same for google bot yeah you need to get that data um and if you dont or if you dont record all the relevant data um its like playing go when half the board is invisible to you yeah youre not going to be able to good to make good business decision or seo strategy decisions going forward you have impartial data uh or partial data i should actually say not impartial partial now number three another problem i often see is uh blocking bots with firewalls uh see a lot of sites that are aggressively proactively blocking bots and with that um yeah you do need to double check that youre not accidentally accidentally blocking google bot because uh if even these b protection services that are being sold out there they dont get it right yeah not always so you may be accidentally blocking google b which is something that google bol has also complained about um now some of that might show up here in in this particular report saying like hey uh we cant reach your pce because its blocked but its not the only reason why might pop up here so keep in mind its not the final solution or the final answer but it may give you an indication now you do might know that google gole also publishes uh the ip addresses that they crawl from right and we can use those uh to whit list great whit list however they are being updated regularly so uh as a result you need to make sure that the it team updates them regularly otherwise again youre blocking and you need to do the moment that they actually update it yeah thats another thing but also if you do any log parsing or compar and and analysis later on on log files from a year ago that list may be updated and ip addresses may have been removed because that happens too and so now a log log entry from a year ago you may not a be able to verify because the ip address isnt being used anymore unless you have historic data for that ip address so you can use tools like this now the better approach when you do work with firewalls and an overly aggressive it team uh on blocking bots uh first allow the bots set a threshold once you have a certain threshold verify if you should block the bot like this could be like a th000 qu requests an hour or week or whatever yeah talk about what is reasonable and at that point block if needed but take a reactive approach rather than a proactive approach yeah now another topic on the other side now we had talked about bots we also have the other side are you human yeah and you may have seen these type of screens where like hey are you a human and google has complained about that too because they also cause a problem for seo for example they generate these infinite space of urls on your domain especially when you use services like cloud flare because in their situation they basically take over your domain on name server level and they just append it to the path and you dont you dont have control at that point now um also the responses that were giving may not be actually content but there 200 status code so again something that google has complained about if you use cloud f services make sure that you have this line on your robot of txt even if you do not uh use the challenge uh feature of like are you a bot or not just have it because if one of your organization in your organization enables it you want to have it there from day one yeah so its a simple line added if you use cloud flare as a simple example and they also say so please add this so its nothing too new but a lot of people dont um if you use cloud storage also fun fun thing uh to use cloud storage we can for example use aws uh as three buckets here the first one is nasa uh page if you look at the nasa page the actual nasa page is also live on nasagov and theyre basically identical d well theyre basically duplicat the the the thing is its nasa they did not add a canonical yeah um yes that happens um now but thats not the only place we al also can find these storage buckets for example at google no its not limit or digital spaces from digital ocean or whatever theres a whole bunch of these type of pockets out there where we have duplicates of our content yeah uh low balances is another example uh here two examples of low balances um great right on google user contentcom if you run containerized apps or serverless apps you may have it also for example if you running google cloud on google run you may have a run apppp subdomain yeah and again with all your stuff duplicated uh if you outsource uh heres a wp engine example i dont know if you guys can see it but the top is basically pages all index alternate page with proper uh canonical tag and the bottom is the user declared is the root domain what however is happening the root domain is not being served as primary instead the wp engine subdomain is rendered as the primary despite the root being mentioned also even in the sitemap yeah cdns similar story can happen there too heres mos with most of their pages duplicated yes it also happens to us seos yeah but no not the only ones master class similar story photo deck similar story if we look there again 200 status codes on both ses um if we also look at some of the bigger guys gold goldman sex similar story duplicated even there we can find they have a canonical in place still its indexed meaning chonicles dont always work its a suggestion you cant rely on them yeah and especially with this type of duplicate duplic content issue you really cannot so keep that in mind now one of those things also happened to me obviously which is one of the reasons why i made this deck in the first place this happened to me in the last few years a few times i do develop a lot of apps and stuff like that i containerized them normally i launch them in the cloud i put them on google run and i want often also uh things to run fast so it also a low balancer as well as cd use the google cdn network now with that i know i have to put up a redirect straight off because if the host name has that run app thing i wanted to redirect it to the main domain yeah so i do that first so bum i put a redirect on i detect the host name if it contains uh run app if it ends on that then i redirected to the main domain leave the path intact um so its basically tre on deep redirect and i do all the usual checks on my side everything is fine yeah on my main domain i check basic tools all the tools you can think of j octopus deep lumar or enro or whatever you know screaming fog it all works fine of course that things to optimize but overall no alarm bells go off and then i got this email 500 and i get this really weird euro and ill blow it out a little bit its this one really weird hp public ac 01 ac01 c gcp e d3 etc im like wait yeah okay so i look a little bit deeper i see gcp google cloud platform reference then i see with with someone else who has the same problem as me doesnt know it uh they there i also see a reference to open caching so i now have to look into open caching and yes theres a protocol open caching protocol that distributes content to open cdns like with isp etc so now i have to add another line to my reader now i know this works because after i do i start getting email alerts that yeah the link has been removed its now a 301 great at least that worked so im thinking okay im good right lets look at the back links nope now i see there google user contentcom popping up in my backlinks in google search console so im like whats going on so yeah my content is duplicated again somewhere else on another on another subdomain and im like seriously uh yeah so i have to add that now too to my list um now think thats it nope i know that is the ip oh sorry that was the low balancer so if you look here theres an ip address in reverse so i go to the ip address and yep guess what my website is also accessible there so again i have to add another line to my redirects um you know now then im like okay lets look into whats going on so i go to the low balancer website and then dive into the sitemap what do i find the whole sitemap the host names have been rewritten from my normal domain to guess what the load balancer host name thats why googles indexing it all yeah so im like seriously no so i try to fix it and while im doing that i can get this email from yandex who says yeah your canonical has changed to this weird appspotcom thing im like seriously what is going on yeah so it turns out if youre on the same network uh google proxies and especially some of those russian ones uh they can basically overtake the host name part within the google cloud network apparently i dont know uh but somehow it reseted my my canonical now so im not only canonical are off the side mats are off my content is being duplicated all over the place im like seriously whats going on so i havent even talked about the fact that i also still have to uh add the www by the way so i try to basically look at yes i had to add it too um basically look at whats the cost so i launch my app in python with flash with workor and i find out the url 4 function tries to detect the host name based on the environmental settings normally that works but in cloud environments its a little bit trickier and if you think this is just python no this all applies to all those languages and this is just a few few of them so this is not isolated yeah it really depends on every single one what they fill out with um so yeah im i have this i need to add the www as well im like this getting enough i dont want to do exception after exception exception so i do the other way around i have to now hard code my domain in my code to basically say if it doesnt match that it must be one of the other ones so then redirect yeah now thats of course not great but now i have to hard code domains uh which goes a little bit against the whole dockerized thing but yeah anyway um some considerations if you have this type of problem as well is you want to prevent indexation of this dupli content of course redirect when you can disallow with robot txt if you cant be mindful that you should actually always have a robot at txt because not everyone does for example heres um im just going to go ahead if you want to test your robots txt check also with google but heres the key thing so if you have a bucket if you have your stuff in a bucket and you do not have a robot of txt there you may get something like a 4 or3 or 4 or4 as for for the robots of txt file in your shain bucket yeah that means crawl everything so if your site has a robot at txt but does not have that in the bucket but is duplicated in the bucket so the things that you have excluded on your domain are now fully crawlable from your bucket so the things you dont want to yeah so be mindful keep in mind robot txd also needs to be in that bucket now also uh keep in mind inheritance because not every bucket is on the subdomain meaning in this case its on the subdirectory so ive seen people trying to block with robos txd in the sub but that doesnt work yeah you do need uh it on the root of the origin and in that case were back to the root of the origin that google controls which is a 44 crawl everything not great idol right so be mindful there which type of bucket you have um you also want to disable directory listings because people you know can go in there and there are these grayhead tools that are trying to basically expose every bucket thats out there so not only search engines its also for security purposes disable these things uh and utilize no index if all the other things fail yeah but specifically for the bucket of course because you dont want know index your website be mindful with canonical there to not use it at the same time also one other thing i dont ever almost see anyone do is add their bucket or the cdn um thing like cloudfront etc to google search console you can add it as a uh url prefix and see whats going on there yeah um and set up alerts make sure you have a bunch of alerts that alert you on these things because this is off domain so link alerts and 500 errors i every every 500 error thats generated on any of my websites i get an email thats how i found it initially yeah so these things yes i got hundreds of emails but thats a different problem that is a problem i can solve and i i rather know about it than not know about it you know what i mean so this is one of those things and it depend on your text what you can and cannot do but by all means use all of these link detection things and whatever alerts to to basically see what you uh can do there and now just a quick bonus to add because i do like also processing backhands and i think we can do better there and rick talked about a little bit but uh the key thing is we want to speed websites up and for that reason we want to make sure that our network is fast so we can look at se console and we can see for example this is not stable yeah this is not a stable connection um we also want to reduce latency which is one of the reasons why i launch most of my apps in google cloud because its closer to google bot another reason to put it there yeah um time to first buite rick talked about this morning most definitely something in case youre wondering this is too slow yeah this is better so uh just fyi um if you are going serverless also keep in mind that you want to look at the instances you running and because starting up a new instance is a cold start and even if you have a fast boot uh it takes time now and just as an example i have here bilding like a instance running minimum instance running and being built for that i turn that off and basically did on user request it killed my time to first bite at the end there yeah it just took more time to boot up all the time so you always need to have one running minimum if not two yeah um also make sure you use the latest security things like tls htps uh because they allow you to do some fun stuff with the network im not going to go into detail of that im sure that you guys can read the documentation be mindful though when you are using compressions um that um uh you use also the same one as your cdn uh because i have seen and ive also experienced even firsthand issues where i was using broadly but cdn couldnt support broadly they only use gzip so now uh there was a mismatch in encoding and that actually was uh causing rendering issues in the browser yeah so be mindful there too uh server resources were talking here about cpu ram and disk this is something you really want to optimize as well and go a little bit more than you need to heres an example where i basically uh went to the next level in the standard lifts and it made a huge difference just making that switch thats it nothing more yeah um make sure you have enough resources now of course all of this time to first buy rick talked about morning a lot of this stuff uh can improve the other web vitals too but i also like to look at from the other direction with web vitals and to look at which websites are fast and how are their we basically based on the web vitals which websites have good web vitals and which technologies are they then using yeah so the other way around and um the crux team have a report i heard from rick this morning they are bettering or they are working on the better with a new interface so new stuff com up um but key thing here uh when we look for example at server software um heres the operating systems we can see debian and freebsd doing a lot better ubun does not windows in the middle no big surprise there um but yeah the the you know this can be a consideration when you are considering changing your tx stack yeah you can look at these things is this something that might be better for us uh same when it comes to the type of server uh the http servers its all over the place but if few jump out and some also in the negative way so maybe thats something to consider um also where you want to identify other bottlenecks like for example the distance to the user of course which cloud provider do you use again theres a whole bunch of them if you take the top known ones here uh we can see two really jump out and nether one or aws or zuri yeah and yeah that might be because of that may also not be might be other reasons but this is a consideration this is something to keep in mind when you using the next time uh which language you program your website is python is most definitely not the fastest its the easiest not the fastest everyone faster may want to use another one yeah and we can also see again which uh sites are faster were using which language that this is of course assuming that uh this is all correctly detected its from a sample data set yeah keep that in mind and when we use inmemory or disc caching is also a technique that we can use in the back end really well and heres an example of one of my websites where i implemented it from not to implementing both of them at the same time and it made a huge difference um keep that in mind when were talking about cashable resources every page should be cashable one of the biggest mistakes that i see uh website owners do is use a cdn and then use a cash control of no store which completely defeats the purpose of using a cdn yeah because every request has to still go to the origin so make sure all your resources are cashable and if theyre cashable that also means that you can do a lot more with seo in the right way so thats cool so by all means you can also even have your own edge server it does not need to be a known cdn uh if you look here for example its all over the place so lets take the top three and then we can see farish farish your own implementation yeah can be just as fast as any of those cloud solutions yeah keep that in mind when we have a database um again might better it might be consideration to see which database is faster for you now keep in mind doesnt stop there we also need to look at the latency of our queries for example are we executing uh complex queries like joints etc uh what type of data format do we have how do we store the data sql no sql you know all of this kind of stuff how many queries do we need to send heres a simple hello world installation on wordpress 18 queries through the database hello world 18 queries well though 2000 plus hooks what really i can do a static side thats faster than that come on why do we need this well its because of these type of things in the template most of this stuff is static it never changes it changes on day one and thats it why dont we make these global variables instead yeah save all of those database queries simple things like that um when you have assets uh a lot of people say like yeah just rend them from a bucket that has its advantages um we can use maybe a bucket but im not ecstatic about it i havent seen many websites that actually perform well with that and this also tells me nothing pretty much almost nothing gets about 40 here so with some exceptions at some points im not really excitic about that option you need to test what works for you now of course you can use the server header server timing to record these things in the back end and send that along with the http request or response basically to this uh uh user and grab it with your analytics and basically grab this data and you can see what is really the bottleneck in the back of your uh back end now where you do that and you fix those things you will see your call requests go up because thats what google wants to see as well yeah they will crawl your website more now uh quick takeaways um content quality issues we have a lot of them especially in the cloud um we need to audit this regularly and keep in mind dont limit your ers to just the domain check outside that especially when there are things happening like low balances cdn and whatever uh tackle these issues then find a solution for it um avoid the duplication and optimize the back end please yeah no one wants to be in this situation so uh my name is philly im an ex google engineer and if you have any questions ill be around and if you want a copy of the slide deck you can either reach me on phillycom or sar brother come thank you very much",

100 140 slides so buckle up everyone I just wanted to include a ton of things and uh yeah but before that something extremely important I wanted to say this to everyone because I want you to look around and see how awesome you all are I'm extremely extremely excited to be on stage and to speak to people that I have been inspired by and I've been following and I have been learning from for so many years I'm not going to mention them all but literally I'm super happy to be here so thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me and thank you for listening to my lovely little talk so today we're going to talk about what you really really need uh to start machine learning today um and before I start a presentation I want to do something that I never do because I hate I hate audience participation but I decided you know what you know it's really cold in the room so we need to get moving or something that's what people say when they ask you to do to audience participation so I just want to know I know there's a ton of technical people in the room so I basically want to know the ones that are that consider themselves not so technical so if you I already have a hand up I love it so basically raise your hand like really slightly just let me know that you think that maybe I'm not as technical as the other people in the room and some of these presentations go a little bit over my head okay love it so this presentation is exactly for you so we'll what you need to get started and we'll also run through some tasks basically the task that you uh will get immediate value from um and we'll also run through what you actually need to grow as uh machine learning engineer I'm kidding as an SEO that uses machine learning because let's face it we're not machine learning Engineers we just want to do our job a little bit faster that's it and I do want to caveat you will have a hard time selling some of these models at this present time because everyone is hyped up on a geni train and but you will see hopefully by the end of this presentation that with some of the classical ml models you will get faster results it will be quicker it will be better it will be more precise so if you can actually make that case to your stakeholders then you can actually sell them these models and these tools and processes as opposed to using chat GPT in your firm which is what we all want to do so what you really need to start most of the people that are getting into machine learning are struggling with like limiting beliefs so maybe you started a project and you kind of failed or it took you way too long to execute like I don't know I I still people I still see people struggling with entity analysis and I get it I completely get it if you're a complete beginner you start a project you work on it it doesn't really work and then you use a tool and the results are not that great and you don't understand what's going on so that's one case the other case may be you're thinking that you're not technical enough that you this goes over your head that whatever the reason you know uh imposter syndrome right I'm not good enough to do this why should I be doing this why am I the person to isn't there some like more technical person to do this and so on so these are challenges that not only we struggle with as marketers trying to do something technical but also data scientists and machine learning engineers so what you really need is to know when to search for machine learning models when to how to actually implement it uh what model to use how to find the precise model that you need to use for the task and what you can achieve in a very short amount of time to actually get value out of the work that you're doing so let's start with the basics for every project that you are working on you need to think about three things the characteristics ICS of the tasks the data and the solution so in terms of task characteristics you can think of machine learning very very basic understanding you have supervised unsupervised so examples for supervised might be regression and classification for unsupervised it might be clustering or dimensionality reduction and I know this means nothing so let's simplify it a little bit you have labeled data that's what supervised means you have something to validate your results against for unsupervised you don't have a way to validate your results and what classification means is that you are trying to group Things based on characteristics labels that you already have just sorting things into buckets and um a regression means making predictions right different types of data here for um unclassified you can cluster things uh again same thing but without having uh those labels just grouping based on Comm characteristics or just reducing uh for dimensionality reduction reducing the complexity of data so this is a very very simplified view of the most common things that you'll be working on but I just want to highlight machine learning is a massive field okay you're not going to become experts in two days regardless of what LinkedIn post tells you that you can you can be I'm sorry you won't uh and this is like a very you know small part of it so generative AI is in there transform former models um but you also have like things like forecasting you also have things like NLP uh and it also like part of machine learning are the models that power uh things like Tesla for instance or things like SpaceX or whatever I I can't believe I mentioned two Elon Musk products I'm sorry for everyone I I I hate myself as well um so yeah the field is massive so bear with that you're doing something just to make your job easier not to actually become an expert in it so that's a good mindset to start and also whenever you are choosing uh the task you know what you're going to actually do also think about if you have the data to selft Trin a model not a lot of you do I just want to say it like not a lot of people can actually train a motel from scratch you need a lot of data to do that um or you can use a pre-trained model a model that has been trained by a company think things like profit for instance for forecasting it works well because it has a ton of data that it has been trained on if you're trying to train a prediction model from scratch it's going to take a ton of time or you can also fine-tune a model which means you take a pre-trained model you give it a small data set of new data to learn from and then it can work a little bit better just doing the task on other data that you have this works very well for Niche tasks so for instance if you're doing classification on Medical Art articles related to something very Niche I don't want to mention any diseases CU I'm in a very good mood today and also if you are going down the route of training do you have enough data to actually train test and validate your results these are questions that you need to ask so definitely the more harder route when it comes to um working with machine learning models so when it comes to data think is your data textual is it numeric is it image based is it time series so tons of questions but that's like the easy part to solve then it when it comes to Solutions I love this flowchart I'm very sorry I don't have attribution but I'm sure I have it somewhere on my website is the task Mission critical like does your job depend on the project that you're working on and if it does why would you want to incorporate AI into it like why would you want to rely on AI so what really is a pet peeve of mine is the people that tell you that you can actually replace your content strategy with uh chat GPT like why would you want that isn't your job like a Content strategist you know anyway if you need consistent results every time unsupervised machine learning is not the way to go Transformers and llms and generative AI is not the way to go deep learning is also not the way to go if you need your results to be easy to understand to relate to stakeholders again deep learning is not the way to go but if you can just outperform the current methods that you have so for instance if you have an intern writing image captions please don't please don't make them do that job but if you do for some reason in 20 24 don't don't raise your hand please because I will hate you but if you do there's better ways to do that and the output will be much better and that goes for metad descriptions and that goes for even things like title op iations for certain niches as well so always assess the usefulness of machine learning models depending on multiple factors how easy it is to deploy what's the bottom line what time are you going to be saving how easy it is to actually get started utilizing this technology do you need it to be scaled across an organization and so forth so how to find things when you have an idea you need to keep your queries specific to these three characteristics so if you're writing metad descriptions for instance analyze is your data textual yes it is is it Mission critical not really do you need an explanation on how you wrote those 10,000 met descriptions not really so you can go ahead for titles it's a little bit more complex for certain industries it might not be a good idea to autogenerate titles your money or life topics are a great example per image captioning it's a little bit more of a gray area still unfortunately so you can still automate some of these parts and you can mix and match different models to do that so let's go to the meat of the this um presentation what to actually do to drive immediate value out of machine learning so I'm going to go through I don't know how many I think there are 10 different projects that you can do so we'll start with text classification classification like we mentioned we have a list of categories list of labels we have content and we don't know where that content fits in so we have labeled data we have the content we want to put it into the these buckets easy right quick check-in who knows this is a supervised machine learning approach we are working with textual data and we do need to have some sort of prediction and the labels that we are taking are from an API that we will be using so Google natural language API we will be mentioning it a few times because it has several different models that work very good they have more than 13,000 sorry 1300 categories I wish there 30,000 but no um and essentially the process that we're going to be working with it will take no longer than 20 minutes even for the most uh technically uh challenge people in the room um we essentially create an API key we identify the content to scrape scrape the content with screaming frog or your crawler of choice even if I'm sure most of you have actually built a crawler so you do you enter the URLs and the content and then get the data it's good because you not only get some categories you have primary secondary tertiary um categories and even deeper levels for some of these but you also have a Precision score why is this good because you as the person completing this task can set a threshold to say everything below 70% is not a good classification that's not accurate enough and I'm not going to be using that so this is very good to actually justify why some of the these articles you might want to send for manual review to be reclassified or you might want to classify them yourself and Implement something like automl uh which is um fine-tuning algorithm like we mentioned at the start uh to actually improve the prediction accuracies for these articles there's a plug and play template in looker Studio on ML for SEO and you will be able to actually interactively see which of those categories when you click on them um what category they're made up made out of so here if you actually look at the primary categories you will see things like news or arts and entertainment or um there things like health and politics and things like that so what are those these are really good like primary categories and then uh which I mean categories on your site right and then you have secondary and tertiary that you can use for tagging systems if you don't really have a good tagging system in place so even if you just Implement that or tweak them a little little bit you will have improved your internal linking for the content on your website immediately right so again with the template you can do a little bit more so some of the people in the room are probably thinking I've seen some someone on LinkedIn do this for two minutes not 10 or 20 why shouldn't I do this a chat GPT because it can also give me some classifications right basically well it's it's not trained for this task so tat DPT is a general purpose model it's trained on a lot of text um and it gives you unpredictable results so every time you run it it will give you different categories and it will not give you any Precision score you can ask of course you can ask it will give you some numbers but that's not really a Precision score is it so this is why if you need tasks with Precision which you do because you're professional technical SEO you lack numbers you do need to use a tailored specified model that has been trained for this task specifically and this is why in this particular instance Google Cloud's API wins let's talk about clustering very very similar in nature but here we don't have the labels we only have the content we want to see what are the similar topics that the content tackles so that we can actually group the content together this is very very good if you see on this list of 1300 categories That You Don't See categories that match your um s content so it essentially gives you the main topics but most importantly it also gives you how these topics interconnect within separate pages what this means is every topic is tackled by different pages simultaneously because there are subtopics mentioned in the content because as we humans right we don't only write on one thing we mention different entities and different semantically related Concepts and so on so that's what this topic modeling algorithm actually does there is a video no coding needed just 20 minutes of your time or whatever just to implement LDA no code topical modeling on your website what it gives you is all of the different topics on your site how they connect to one another how how similar they are how close linked they are to one another but most importantly you Al it also gives you for individual Pages the different topics that are mentioned within those pages so if you're following my drift this is a very very good way to improve your internal linking systems on your site very easily but you can also use something that's a lot more complex in terms of the model because LDA is quite basic it came out like 20 years ago so bird topic is an alternative that is a more recent and it has been created by a marketer that actually turned an ml Engineers that could be you in like a couple of years or something I don't know so it gives you the opportunity to actually build your own custom model using different choices of um architecture um at each of the steps that need to be performed this works very well if you're a really big nerd and a techie you're doing topic modeling all the time for different companies Industries websites and so forth and you want to test out different configurations to see what works best and it follows the same principle it embeds the documents it semantically groups them together and it extracts the topic models so how you would structure that in a project we already talked about classification get those class classes these are your primary categories you also have a very overall naming or group for your content but you can also get topic models and subtopics and then you can also extract entities and Link articles together based on these three things so you can link pages that mention the same subtopic you can also link based on the same or semantically related entities and you can also uh improve your categorization and tagging system on your website this shouldn't take you more than an hour so quick quins here let's talk about keyword clustering so again again dimensionality reduction here we are essentially taking a keyword and we're only selecting one word or two words from it depending on your configuration to say these are the most important terms in this keyword this is not entity analysis but I don't need to explain that to you but still these are the most semantically important terms so how it works again tokenizes uh extract embeddings and then it gives you uh the most important word so in simple terms from every sentence from every keyword you have one word that is you know the most vital one that's how every keyword clustering tool um Works more or less there's a great video for beginners just to understand um how it works but essentially you can identify one word you can also choose to identify a Bagram which is a link of two words and they don't need to very crucially they don't need to be following one another in the keyword that you provide which is very important um because otherwise it won't be as accurate right and you can also give a full content piece to actually identify the main terms from the content that you have and actually see if you're over stuffing with the keywords that you have but you don't want to do this you just want to give it a Google sheet spreadsheet and you just wanted to give away the keyword categories and the Clusters and all of that stuff you can do that so Google collab is linked in the slides you'll get the slides later you give it the keywords it gives you a list of the primary term and it also gives you the Byram awesome right let's talk about entities I'm not going to tell you what the difference between keywords and entities is you can ask me later if you want but I'm sure you already know it but why it is important to actually not think just about topics but also think about the entities that make up the topic well because that's what all of the search engines are doing that's what people are doing whenever you are thinking about a certain topic you're also thinking about all of the things that need to happen related to that topic if you're traveling to a conference you're thinking about your travel how are you going to get there are you going to use an Uber which is a company and are you going to sit next to your friend some Tories that is a person you know all of these types of things that's how you're thinking about uh everything so again process to identify entities shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes you run a script same like before same API same API key you already have the key and you get the entity data in seconds what is awesome about this is you get not only the identified entity from the content but you also get what type of entity it is how prominent it is how important is it for the text that you have analyzed how many times it has been mentioned and also what are the different types of wordings that are being used whenever this entity is mentioned so for instance for an entity like um Barack Obama he could be mentioned like Barack Mr Obama former president of the United States best person in the world or whatever I'm sure some people uh regard him as such so essentially you do have all of this and you also have a link to like a Wikipedia page or something that uh could show you whether this is a very prominent entity just in your data set if it doesn't have a Wikipedia page or if it's a very prominent entity in the world overall if that makes sense what possible data points can you use this in SEO basically everything you can analyze your content analyze your competitor's content you can scrape YouTube videos and analyze the entities that are being discussed over there you can also do the same for Reddit any social mentions you can analyze your customer feedback that you're collecting and it's just sitting collecting dust for nobody to analyze uh and you can also do internal link text ters and all of these cool stuff does it matter how you do it yeah of course it does don't use chat GPT for this I promise I will get to a section with good use cases for chat GPT it's coming um but use a tailored model use a model that has been custom trained for this job again here why does an API like Google Cloud's API win or even the ones that Asia or AWS have because they are trained for this job they're they give you a ton of data that is precise they give you data that you can actually further analyze um and they don't hallucinate they don't give you entities that are not actually entities you know and these are the type of entities that they use in their Knowledge Graph as well so why wouldn't you use the models that they use doesn't make any sense cool so let's talk about fuzzy matching then that's similarity between two strings I have a 30 minute video on it so I'm not going to bore you with the details you can uh talk to Patrick wherever he is he was here a second ago but he no longer is um essentially how to use that for redirect mapping check the similarity between URLs he has a great script for that you can also use the same to actually analiz competitor titles and metad descriptions from Sur analysis but you can also use that to actually detect whether you should have a structured data type on your website this is a cool project a lot of the companies are not automating this but it is a cool project just to kind of test your skills so from a blog post for instance if you see question marks in your headings and headings that are titled the way that FAQs would be titled then you can run the sale paste the out the output the script is going to tokenize everything and it's going going to give you structured data in an FAQ format right easy for more complex websites you can use something like uto ml um and massive shout out to Hamlet Batista may he rest in peace CU he was one of the biggest inspiration in my career and this is an article from him for like five years ago or four years ago so he was like way ahead of everyone so yeah massive shout out okay content moderation same API by the way we're still working with the same API that's the third mention but there's two more use cases which I'm not going to mention in this presentation what the content moderation model does is it automatically analyzes text for inappropriate or undesirable content it wants to show you how to maintain a clean and professional data set without manually reviewing each end and when I read that I was like hm that's cool is that not like detecting whether the content is your M or your life CU that sounds awfully similar to what Lily Ray has described that it means right topics that affect your happiness health Financial stability or safety so if you look at the categories that this API that is owned by Google does it's actually those four categories right you have things like is it a health related topic is it religion does it um talk about guns or like Public Safety and things like that so you if you have um again scraped content run it through the API it actually analyzes whether your content falls into any of these categories so if you see red here well you're actually talking about something that's your money or your life and should you be I don't know it depends on your website but if you see your rankings tanking and you have no explanation give it a go maybe you'll find some little Snippets that your content writers are putting in their personal opinions on your company blog and you're actually going to see that you know they shouldn't be you know uh so I scraped Reddit actually to show you how it works and of course there's a SEO Reddit sorry which is even better so there's a ton of different opinions there there's some post that are fine some post are not fine so basically that's how it works yeah not going to spend too much time on this and the possible data points here are your content your competitor's content YouTube video transcripts again uh social media mentions comments on your website um Community post that you are managing like forums and things like that just to make sure that everything is running correctly okay exciting stuff we don't want to be working on blogs anymore I see a ton of Consultants transitioning slowly from SEO to marketing and talking more about the YouTube landscape Tik Tok and all of the other stuff so if you have a Tik Tok um you know presence but you don't have a Blog you can transcribe it there's a ton of tools that you can use again the bigger tools work better but there are still no code approaches that you can incorporate in your day-to-day but the bigger tools are still better with the exception again of open apis with which only works if your video is under 5 minutes long uh and if it is not in a small language so if it is in English it will work caveat I'm not saying spam your blog with auto transcribed content and I'm not saying scrape your competitor YouTube videos transcribe and get traffic to the Moon bro I'm not saying that what I am saying is that you can Bridge the gaps between different teams if you're working in an Enterprise organization and if they are creating really good webinar style interviews content you can actually turn that into videos for instance our lectures right now are recorded the conference organizers can come to the lectures and they can ask us would you like us to create a blog post they can transcribe that easy peasy traffic to the website right that's what I am saying make your content work harder distribute better and use transcription for competitor analysis as well if you are trying to enter um YouTube as a niche mix and match with different approaches so for instance you can scrip audio transcribe you can classify the content categorize create subtopics extract entities and all of these cool stuff again like we discussed incorporate that into your strategy and boom you're not only thinking about blog content you're thinking about the YouTube landscape as well you can do the same in the other formats so text audio this is even more complex in terms of understanding how not to spam the web with trash um but still programmatic approaches they exist Google Cloud works really good I'm not saying fill YouTube with trash please don't we already have enough of it but what I am saying is certain content formats don't really require a rich video format to accompany them and that's tutorials that's documentation that's interview styles that only exist in uh blog format and uh you can also add automation like person to camera videos without actually having to record fullblown like hundreds of thousands of tutorials by creating digital avatars that work quite well for Content that doesn't really need to be as personal you so text to text transformation okay I told you we're going to talk about open Ai and good use cases so here any kind of llm can work for transcribe sorry for transforming your blog content to social media posts so that works quite well there's uh awesome gpts from Caitlyn Hathaway any llm is going to do a good job here if you want to transform your blog post to newsletter editions to social media posts transform PDFs into actionable guides and so forth amazing stuff and while we're on the topic of llms doing a good job if you have structur data so for instance if you have like um database of statistics for MBA players like what Ellas did you can create a prompt for an llm and actually create content based on the structured data but you can also do the same for uh user reviews to build a summary of what people think overall for your product you can also do the same for product databases to build individual product descriptions if if you combine structured data you reduce the opportunity for the llm to hallucinate and you're actually working with data that is real life right another good use case is to write titles using fuzzy matching as well you take your queries from search console you scrape uh the titles and the headings and all of the other stuff you essentially combine uh the queries with the titles and you generate new titles using open AI that contain partially some of these queries to make them more user friendly okay we're done a ton a ton a ton of ideas hopefully you implement at least some of them but what you really need to grow in this field in my opinion because this is a very introductory level talk um you need the right mindset you need a community of people that are learning and failing and achieving things right alongside you and you also need resources that are beginner friendly intermediate Advanced so that's what I'm trying to build at ml for SEO we have a ton of free resources we have a newsletter we have a slack Community with over 400 people in it which I'm still surprised by um but so many people learning machine learning for SEO we also have free templates everything that has been talked about in this presentation is there there there already and also blog posts and all of the other cool stuff there will also be an academy that will launch later this year uh and you can always always contact me and you know talk to me about the projects that you're working on I would love to help you out and see what people are doing with this technology if it's not chip so thank you so much for listening",
        "cleaned_text": "applause hello everyone i dont know if this is loud enough or not its my second time using a mic like this so hopefully it will be loud if not just let me know okay so i have 100 140 slides so buckle up everyone i just wanted to include a ton of things and uh yeah but before that something extremely important i wanted to say this to everyone because i want you to look around and see how awesome you all are im extremely extremely excited to be on stage and to speak to people that i have been inspired by and ive been following and i have been learning from for so many years im not going to mention them all but literally im super happy to be here so thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me and thank you for listening to my lovely little talk so today were going to talk about what you really really need uh to start machine learning today um and before i start a presentation i want to do something that i never do because i hate i hate audience participation but i decided you know what you know its really cold in the room so we need to get moving or something thats what people say when they ask you to do to audience participation so i just want to know i know theres a ton of technical people in the room so i basically want to know the ones that are that consider themselves not so technical so if you i already have a hand up i love it so basically raise your hand like really slightly just let me know that you think that maybe im not as technical as the other people in the room and some of these presentations go a little bit over my head okay love it so this presentation is exactly for you so well what you need to get started and well also run through some tasks basically the task that you uh will get immediate value from um and well also run through what you actually need to grow as uh machine learning engineer im kidding as an seo that uses machine learning because lets face it were not machine learning engineers we just want to do our job a little bit faster thats it and i do want to caveat you will have a hard time selling some of these models at this present time because everyone is hyped up on a geni train and but you will see hopefully by the end of this presentation that with some of the classical ml models you will get faster results it will be quicker it will be better it will be more precise so if you can actually make that case to your stakeholders then you can actually sell them these models and these tools and processes as opposed to using chat gpt in your firm which is what we all want to do so what you really need to start most of the people that are getting into machine learning are struggling with like limiting beliefs so maybe you started a project and you kind of failed or it took you way too long to execute like i dont know i i still people i still see people struggling with entity analysis and i get it i completely get it if youre a complete beginner you start a project you work on it it doesnt really work and then you use a tool and the results are not that great and you dont understand whats going on so thats one case the other case may be youre thinking that youre not technical enough that you this goes over your head that whatever the reason you know uh imposter syndrome right im not good enough to do this why should i be doing this why am i the person to isnt there some like more technical person to do this and so on so these are challenges that not only we struggle with as marketers trying to do something technical but also data scientists and machine learning engineers so what you really need is to know when to search for machine learning models when to how to actually implement it uh what model to use how to find the precise model that you need to use for the task and what you can achieve in a very short amount of time to actually get value out of the work that youre doing so lets start with the basics for every project that you are working

just reducing uh for dimensionality reduction reducing the complexity of data so this is a very very simplified view of the most common things that youll be working on but i just want to highlight machine learning is a massive field okay youre not going to become experts in two days regardless of what linkedin post tells you that you can you can be im sorry you wont uh and this is like a very you know small part of it so generative ai is in there transform former models um but you also have like things like forecasting you also have things like nlp uh and it also like part of machine learning are the models that power uh things like tesla for instance or things like spacex or whatever i i cant believe i mentioned two elon musk products im sorry for everyone i i i hate myself as well um so yeah the field is massive so bear with that youre doing something just to make your job easier not to actually become an expert in it so thats a good mindset to start and also whenever you are choosing uh the task you know what youre going to actually do also think about if you have the data to selft trin a model not a lot of you do i just want to say it like not a lot of people can actually train a motel from scratch you need a lot of data to do that um or you can use a pretrained model a model that has been trained by a company think things like profit for instance for forecasting it works well because it has a ton of data that it has been trained on if youre trying to train a prediction model from scratch its going to take a ton of time or you can also finetune a model which means you take a pretrained model you give it a small data set of new data to learn from and then it can work a little bit better just doing the task on other data that you have this works very well for niche tasks so for instance if youre doing classification on medical art articles related to something very niche i dont want to mention any diseases cu im in a very good mood today and also if you are going down the route of training do you have enough data to actually train test and validate your results these are questions that you need to ask so definitely the more harder route when it comes to um working with machine learning models so when it comes to data think is your data textual is it numeric is it image based is it time series so tons of questions but thats like the easy part to solve then it when it comes to solutions i love this flowchart im very sorry i dont have attribution but im sure i have it somewhere on my website is the task mission critical like does your job depend on the project that youre working on and if it does why would you want to incorporate ai into it like why would you want to rely on ai so what really is a pet peeve of mine is the people that tell you that you can actually replace your content strategy with uh chat gpt like why would you want that isnt your job like a content strategist you know anyway if you need consistent results every time unsupervised machine learning is not the way to go transformers and llms and generative ai is not the way to go deep learning is also not the way to go if you need your results to be easy to understand to relate to stakeholders again deep learning is not the way to go but if you can just outperform the current methods that you have so for instance if you have an intern writing image captions please dont please dont make them do that job but if you do for some reason in 20 24 dont dont raise your hand please because i will hate you but if you do theres better ways to do that and the output will be much better and that goes for metad descriptions and that goes for even things like title op iations for certain niches as well so always assess the usefulness of machine learning models depending on multiple factors how easy it is to deploy whats the bottom line what time are you going to be saving how easy it is to actually get started utilizing this technology do you need it to be scaled across an organization and so forth so how to find things when you have an idea you need to keep your queries specific to these three characteristics so if youre writing metad descriptions for instance analyze is your data textual yes it is is it mission critical not really do you need an explanation on how you wrote those 10000 met descriptions not really so you can go ahead for titles its a little bit more complex for certain industries it might not be a good idea to autogenerate titles your money or life topics are a great example per image captioning its a little bit more of a gray area still unfortunately so you can still automate some of these parts and you can mix and match different models to do that so lets go to the meat of the this um presentation what to actually do to drive immediate value out of machine learning so im going to go through i dont know how many i think there are 10 different projects that you can do so well start with text classification classification like we mentioned we have a list of categories list of labels we have content and we dont know where that content fits in so we have labeled data we have the content we want to put it into the these buckets easy right quick checkin who knows this is a supervised machine learning approach we are working with textual data and we do need to have some sort of prediction and the labels that we are taking are from an api that we will be using so google natural language api we will be mentioning it a few times because it has several different models that work very good they have more than 13000 sorry 1300 categories i wish there 30000 but no um and essentially the process that were going to be working with it will take no longer than 20 minutes even for the most uh technically uh challenge people in the room um we essentially create an api key we identify the content to scrape scrape the content with screaming frog or your crawler of choice even if im sure most of you have actually built a crawler so you do you enter the urls and the content and then get the data its good because you not only get some categories you have primary secondary tertiary um categories and even deeper levels for some of these but you also have a precision score why is this good because you as the person completing this task can set a threshold to say everything below 70 is not a good classification thats not accurate enough and im not going to be using that so this is very good to actually justify why some of the these articles you might want to send for manual review to be reclassified or you might want to classify them yourself and implement something like automl uh which is um finetuning algorithm like we mentioned at the start uh to actually improve the prediction accuracies for these articles theres a plug and play template in looker studio on ml for seo and you will be able to actually interactively see which of those categories when you click on them um what category theyre made up made out of so here if you actually look at the primary categories you will see things like news or arts and entertainment or um there things like health and politics and things like that so what are those these are really good like primary categories and then uh which i mean categories on your site right and then you have secondary and tertiary that you can use for tagging systems if you dont really have a good tagging system in place so even if you just implement that or tweak them a little little bit you will have improved your internal linking for the content on your website immediately right so again with the template you can do a little bit more so some of the people in the room are probably thinking ive seen some someone on linkedin do this for two minutes not 10 or 20 why shouldnt i do this a chat gpt because it can also give me some classifications right basically well its its not trained for this task so tat dpt is a general purpose model its trained on a lot of text um and it gives you unpredictable results so every time you run it it will give you different categories and it will not give you any precision score you can ask of course you can ask it will give you some numbers but thats not really a precision score is it so this is why if you need tasks with precision which you do because youre professional technical seo you lack numbers you do need to use a tailored specified model that has been trained for this task specifically and this is why in this particular instance google clouds api wins lets talk about clustering very very similar in nature but here we dont have the labels we only have the content we want to see what are the similar topics that the content tackles so that we can actually group the content together this is very very good if you see on this list of 1300 categories that you dont see categories that match your um s content so it essentially gives you the main topics but most importantly it also gives you how these topics interconnect within separate pages what this means is every topic is tackled by different pages simultaneously because there are subtopics mentioned in the content because as we humans right we dont only write on one thing we mention different entities and different semantically related concepts and so on so thats what this topic modeling algorithm actually does there is a video no coding needed just 20 minutes of your time or whatever just to implement lda no code topical modeling on your website what it gives you is all of the different topics on your site how they connect to one another how how similar they are how close linked they are to one another but most importantly you al it also gives you for individual pages the different topics that are mentioned within those pages so if youre following my drift this is a very very good way to improve your internal linking systems on your site very easily but you can also use something thats a lot more complex in terms of the model because lda is quite basic it came out like 20 years ago so bird topic is an alternative that is a more recent and it has been created by a marketer that actually turned an ml engineers that could be you in like a couple of years or something i dont know so it gives you the opportunity to actually build your own custom model using different choices of um architecture um at each of the steps that need to be performed this works very well if youre a really big nerd and a techie youre doing topic modeling all the time for different companies industries websites and so forth and you want to test out different configurations to see what works best and it follows the same principle it embeds the documents it semantically groups them together and it extracts the topic models so how you would structure that in a project we already talked about classification get those class classes these are your primary categories you also have a very overall naming or group for your content but you can also get topic models and subtopics and then you can also extract entities and link articles together based on these three things so you can link pages that mention the same subtopic you can also link based on the same or semantically related entities and you can also uh improve your categorization and tagging system on your website this shouldnt take you more than an hour so quick quins here lets talk about keyword clustering so again again dimensionality reduction here we are essentially taking a keyword and were only selecting one word or two words from it depending on your configuration to say these are the most important terms in this keyword this is not entity analysis but i dont need to explain that to you but still these are the most semantically important terms so how it works again tokenizes uh extract embeddings and then it gives you uh the most important word so in simple terms from every sentence from every keyword you have one word that is you know the most vital one thats how every keyword clustering tool um works more or less theres a great video for beginners just to understand um how it works but essentially you can identify one word you can also choose to identify a bagram which is a link of two words and they dont need to very crucially they dont need to be following one another in the keyword that you provide which is very important um because otherwise it wont be as accurate right and you can also give a full content piece to actually identify the main terms from the content that you have and actually see if youre over stuffing with the keywords that you have but you dont want to do this you just want to give it a google sheet spreadsheet and you just wanted to give away the keyword categories and the clusters and all of that stuff you can do that so google collab is linked in the slides youll get the slides later you give it the keywords it gives you a list of the primary term and it also gives you the byram awesome right lets talk about entities im not going to tell you what the difference between keywords and entities is you can ask me later if you want but im sure you already know it but why it is important to actually not think just about topics but also think about the entities that make up the topic well because thats what all of the search engines are doing thats what people are doing whenever you are thinking about a certain topic youre also thinking about all of the things that need to happen related to that topic if youre traveling to a conference youre thinking about your travel how are you going to get there are you going to use an uber which is a company and are you going to sit next to your friend some tories that is a person you know all of these types of things thats how youre thinking about uh everything so again process to identify entities shouldnt take you more than 20 minutes you run a script same like before same api same api key you already have the key and you get the entity data in seconds what is awesome about this is you get not only the identified entity from the content but you also get what type of entity it is how prominent it is how important is it for the text that you have analyzed how many times it has been mentioned and also what are the different types of wordings that are being used whenever this entity is mentioned so for instance for an entity like um barack obama he could be mentioned like barack mr obama former president of the united states best person in the world or whatever im sure some people uh regard him as such so essentially you do have all of this and you also have a link to like a wikipedia page or something that uh could show you whether this is a very prominent entity just in your data set if it doesnt have a wikipedia page or if its a very prominent entity in the world overall if that makes sense what possible data points can you use this in seo basically everything you can analyze your content analyze your competitors content you can scrape youtube videos and analyze the entities that are being discussed over there you can also do the same for reddit any social mentions you can analyze your customer feedback that youre collecting and its just sitting collecting dust for nobody to analyze uh and you can also do internal link text ters and all of these cool stuff does it matter how you do it yeah of course it does dont use chat gpt for this i promise i will get to a section with good use cases for chat gpt its coming um but use a tailored model use a model that has been custom trained for this job again here why does an api like google clouds api win or even the ones that asia or aws have because they are trained for this job theyre they give you a ton of data that is precise they give you data that you can actually further analyze um and they dont hallucinate they dont give you entities that are not actually entities you know and these are the type of entities that they use in their knowledge graph as well so why wouldnt you use the models that they use doesnt make any sense cool so lets talk about fuzzy matching then thats similarity between two strings i have a 30 minute video on it so im not going to bore you with the details you can uh talk to patrick wherever he is he was here a second ago but he no longer is um essentially how to use that for redirect mapping check the similarity between urls he has a great script for that you can also use the same to actually analiz competitor titles and metad descriptions from sur analysis but you can also use that to actually detect whether you should have a structured data type on your website this is a cool project a lot of the companies are not automating this but it is a cool project just to kind of test your skills so from a blog post for instance if you see question marks in your headings and headings that are titled the way that faqs would be titled then you can run the sale paste the out the output the script is going to tokenize everything and its going going to give you structured data in an faq format right easy for more complex websites you can use something like uto ml um and massive shout out to hamlet batista may he rest in peace cu he was one of the biggest inspiration in my career and this is an article from him for like five years ago or four years ago so he was like way ahead of everyone so yeah massive shout out okay content moderation same api by the way were still working with the same api thats the third mention but theres two more use cases which im not going to mention in this presentation what the content moderation model does is it automatically analyzes text for inappropriate or undesirable content it wants to show you how to maintain a clean and professional data set without manually reviewing each end and when i read that i was like hm thats cool is that not like detecting whether the content is your m or your life cu that sounds awfully similar to what lily ray has described that it means right topics that affect your happiness health financial stability or safety so if you look at the categories that this api that is owned by google does its actually those four categories right you have things like is it a health related topic is it religion does it um talk about guns or like public safety and things like that so you if you have um again scraped content run it through the api it actually analyzes whether your content falls into any of these categories so if you see red here well youre actually talking about something thats your money or your life and should you be i dont know it depends on your website but if you see your rankings tanking and you have no explanation give it a go maybe youll find some little snippets that your content writers are putting in their personal opinions on your company blog and youre actually going to see that you know they shouldnt be you know uh so i scraped reddit actually to show you how it works and of course theres a seo reddit sorry which is even better so theres a ton of different opinions there theres some post that are fine some post are not fine so basically thats how it works yeah not going to spend too much time on this and the possible data points here are your content your competitors content youtube video transcripts again uh social media mentions comments on your website um community post that you are managing like forums and things like that just to make sure that everything is running correctly okay exciting stuff we dont want to be working on blogs anymore i see a ton of consultants transitioning slowly from seo to marketing and talking more about the youtube landscape tik tok and all of the other stuff so if you have a tik tok um you know presence but you dont have a blog you can transcribe it theres a ton of tools that you can use again the bigger tools work better but there are still no code approaches that you can incorporate in your daytoday but the bigger tools are still better with the exception again of open apis with which only works if your video is under 5 minutes long uh and if it is not in a small language so if it is in english it will work caveat im not saying spam your blog with auto transcribed content and im not saying scrape your competitor youtube videos transcribe and get traffic to the moon bro im not saying that what i am saying is that you can bridge the gaps between different teams if youre working in an enterprise organization and if they are creating really good webinar style interviews content you can actually turn that into videos for instance our lectures right now are recorded the conference organizers can come to the lectures and they can ask us would you like us to create a blog post they can transcribe that easy peasy traffic to the website right thats what i am saying make your content work harder distribute better and use transcription for competitor analysis as well if you are trying to enter um youtube as a niche mix and match with different approaches so for instance you can scrip audio transcribe you can classify the content categorize create subtopics extract entities and all of these cool stuff again like we discussed incorporate that into your strategy and boom youre not only thinking about blog content youre thinking about the youtube landscape as well you can do the same in the other formats so text audio this is even more complex in terms of understanding how not to spam the web with trash um but still programmatic approaches they exist google cloud works really good im not saying fill youtube with trash please dont we already have enough of it but what i am saying is certain content formats dont really require a rich video format to accompany them and thats tutorials thats documentation thats interview styles that only exist in uh blog format and uh you can also add automation like person to camera videos without actually having to record fullblown like hundreds of thousands of tutorials by creating digital avatars that work quite well for content that doesnt really need to be as personal you so text to text transformation okay i told you were going to talk about open ai and good use cases so here any kind of llm can work for transcribe sorry for transforming your blog content to social media posts so that works quite well theres uh awesome gpts from caitlyn hathaway any llm is going to do a good job here if you want to transform your blog post to newsletter editions to social media posts transform pdfs into actionable guides and so forth amazing stuff and while were on the topic of llms doing a good job if you have structur data so for instance if you have like um database of statistics for mba players like what ellas did you can create a prompt for an llm and actually create content based on the structured data but you can also do the same for uh user reviews to build a summary of what people think overall for your product you can also do the same for product databases to build individual product descriptions if if you combine structured data you reduce the opportunity for the llm to hallucinate and youre actually working with data that is real life right another good use case is to write titles using fuzzy matching as well you take your queries from search console you scrape uh the titles and the headings and all of the other stuff you essentially combine uh the queries with the titles and you generate new titles using open ai that contain partially some of these queries to make them more user friendly okay were done a ton a ton a ton of ideas hopefully you implement at least some of them but what you really need to grow in this field in my opinion because this is a very introductory level talk um you need the right mindset you need a community of people that are learning and failing and achieving things right alongside you and you also need resources that are beginner friendly intermediate advanced so thats what im trying to build at ml for seo we have a ton of free resources we have a newsletter we have a slack community with over 400 people in it which im still surprised by um but so many people learning machine learning for seo we also have free templates everything that has been talked about in this presentation is there there there already and also blog posts and all of the other cool stuff there will also be an academy that will launch later this year uh and you can always always contact me and you know talk to me about the projects that youre working on i would love to help you out and see what people are doing with this technology if its not chip so thank you so much for listening",

too uh y'all trusted us believed in us I'm going to cry up here uh no really really appreciative we're going to do this again next year we'll tell you all about that in a bit so I last year did a big data study uh literally site AIT million websites we don't need to talk about me lots of cool data there lots of issues sites are a mess web the web is messy in general you can actually see the full data but I'm not going to cover the full data here there was a substudy also with h Ling 3 some thousand what 374,000 domains all the issues there there's a whole HF Lane study there we have a cool like visualization tool for HF Lane clusters it's complex but like that makes it super easy to see like what's screwed up in this the thing is just because something's a best practice doesn't mean it's actually important so the most common issues are the ones people aren't actually solving they're not actually working on this because sometimes it costs more to fix something than the value that that actually provides and prioritization of the fixes is hard I use like an impact effort Matrix so I try and say like okay how big is the scale how much impact is this going to have how much is this going to cost calls me when can I do this uh and try and figure out like what am I going to work on what am I actually going to go fix what am I just going to let slide and never fix potentially because it costs too much and there's a lot of things like that again best practices things you should do there's a lot of things that are flagged Even in our side audit that I'm just like h no never going to never going to touch that so you may think like why do SEO tools do this why do they flag things well there could be other issues that you want to dig into a lot of people a lot of the feedback has been like well we use it for sales like oh big red number lots of issues sell that to a client there's a lot of different variables that impact prioritization for different issues just going to give a few examples of those like broken pages so the whole thing like does a tree if a tree falls in the woods does anyone hear the sound so if no one actually like goes to that page if it's not being hit there's no links to the page it's broken do I care no so people some people are like I have to fix those 37,000 broken Pages I'm like n it's okay no one ever sees it not even bad for ux at that point no one sees it right so it's not just SEO like I can argue that from a ux and you can set all kinds of like business Logic for this stuff so like how many hits in the last 30 days do I want to redirect it or how many links blah blah blah redirect it I think this got shared out earlier by someone else uh Sam I think um full text matching redirect script it's also a question of do you even bother like sometimes the redirects were there but then they got lost or whatever uh there's a big study on this that I did I deleted a bunch of redirects over a year Google said it wouldn't do anything it didn't do anything so exactly uh I personally am usually a fan of keeping redirects forever but like if you want to set business logic and say like after a year or two just delete the redirects clean up your system seems to actually be okay I was very skeptical about that by the way it's like I'm going to screw some stuff up multiple H1 tags I still see this it's flagged and this is allow the only question really is are they relevant if you have multiple and they're all relevant who cares good you're you're all good I don't know why a lot of seos focus on this broken images again tree falls in the woods if no one sees it no one goes to that page do I care if an image is broken on the page no one sees it no then there are things that seos tend to prioritize too high uh one is duplicate content usually page is going to be indexed one way or another you're like oh why is like this index with a parameter does it anything not really a lot of the web is duplicate content 60% according to google they're pretty good at figuring this out like they have this whole canonicalization system like 20 or so different signals and they figure out which version of the page to index yeah they get it wrong sometimes but again it's indexed one way or another all the signals usually consolidate I don't care it's fine orphan pages I love when people like focus on this because I'm like you didn't care enough to actually link to it but you think the page is important H fascinating and then whatever is new there's always popular you know for a while it was like mobile friendliness Corb vitals uh there was the whole like mobile gon thing they're like oh it's going to be the end of the world if your site isn't mobile friendly and thud nothing nothing happened there are some things you should worry about though again the the web is messy um it's how what do you actually want to fix for me uh oh sorry this is actually things you should not worry about sorry getting ahead of myself getting ahead of myself one thing redirect chains you know uh I don't even look at these until they get like greater than five some people are like well it slows down blah blah blah someone clicks that it's probably like 0.03 seconds to follow that chain it's fine they'll follow up to 10 hops usually so until it gets over five I don't even look I don't bother why do that work like no basically no impact whatsoever everything is Consolidated double slashes and URLs all this ignored there's I could give a thousand examples for all of these but I only have 30 minutes by the way some HF length things use an underscore instead of a dash guess what no one cares Google's fine with it or even I've seen this in a lot of H refl articles actually mention like I anduk they're like that's for Ukraine no that would be UA actually uh UK is a reserved code and so back when Google had a report on this if you someone used Enuk there was no error in the report in gsse ever it always swapped properly never was an issue never seen it be an issue my entire career but some people are like you need to fix that well it's it's working it's good to probably continue to work until it actually breaks something I don't care what you actually should do is focus on Roi if a site actually was like I'm going to fix everything I'm going to be like you're going to waste so much money you should not do that it's ridiculous I again best practice versus like practical Google's like yeah you should fix all your blah blah blah no like no there's no business case for it to be made I'm a big fan of just taking the easy wins go after the things that matter the most the things that are going to have the most impact so one thing content security policy this isn't going to have a huge impact any impact really but if you want to fix it it's very simple you can do upgrade insecure requests it's going to fix every mixed content issue on your entire website and that's all you got to do takes two minutes I've literally seen teams with like we have like 2,000 links we need to go change and I'm like no what are you doing all attributes not again not the biggest like SEO issue uh literally just counts for um well okay so it helps in image search let me get that out of the way uh but for like ranking of the page itself literally whatever you put there counts as like content on the page that's it where it is a problem it's like accessibility or like legal issues uh so people can be sued uh in the US because yeah you didn't make your I got to stay away from that apparently uh because uh you actually need your website to be accessible if not yeah lawsuits millions of dollars it happens all the time how about redir so my ultimate everything for redir is like I don't want to touch it again I wrote that redirect matching script but like that's just the start that does the matching for the pages you could store all your old content all your new content have the matches just output right there um like here's the matches like top three top five top one however you want to do it and say like do you actually want to do this so you could have it with a click and say like or you literally can automate and say like just do the redirect the next closest thing automatically for me I never have to look at a redirect or you can say like Okay click a button to prove this or like I want this page instead of this page so here's top three choose which one you want to go to and like make it stupid simple for people when you I've seen too many companies that actually have like business people that go put in redirects and do you want to guess how often that goes wrong it is a lot so I I would make this a simple as possible for people and it can basic it can be fully automated it can be partially automated with like approvals or whatever you need to do to actually get it through so what should you care about page is not indexed it should be not indexed you're not going to get traffic simple internal links by the way my slides I have been busy organizing this so I did not get a chance to do design whatsoever finish these like yesterday I'm the bad one here um maybe like page level no follow I'm typically not a fan if you know follow a page at the page level all the internal links get no followed uh if it's user generated content on the page maybe I want to do that but we really don't even know how Google is treating these anymore this is the fun thing Gary yes years ago was like oh yeah we're going to like start following no follow and he's like well if we ever start like counting the links then we'll tell the SEO community and he's like yeah I never asked them about that so do they count no follow links they might now but until someone over there actually goes and asks he's supposed to tell us but until he asks we don't know redir I'm a big fan of redirect why did you know how much money people spend on like link building link acquisition digital PR all those links go to these pages and then two years later someone's like let's just delete that page and all the links go bye-bye easy easy win hre langing some hre langing issues can be very expensive I had won with a lot of other contributing factors terrible business logic people landed on the wrong country forms were not forwarded lot lots of bad things um it was on an e-commerce site and it was losing about $6.5 million do a day like they couldn't check out they go there and they're like you can't use this and we're like well simple thing was first like let's just try like get people to the right place or throw up a thing you're in the wrong country uh but yeah the checkout would not work on these four people in the wrong country so $6.5 million a day that issue broke across like 120 some thousand pages and took about 8 months to clear up from after everything was fixed you know this is this is one of those things where they're like can you just call someone at Google no no sorry all the work for fixing it was done within like a day and we just had to wait months for everything to be recrawled and fixed but that was that was massively painful painful for me too because everyone sorry it's fixed I promise but you have to wait there's a lot of JavaScript issues probably the biggest one that would things like your your content not being loaded in the Dawn by default anyway we are absolutely in exciting times I hope y have seen that with all this AI everything here the world is changing we're at the very start of this really but it's already changing fast I'm pretty excited to see like what's actually going to happen next where where this is all going to go anyone can prototype new ideas you have an idea before you have to like oh I need to like learn some coding and blah blah blah and go build this I used to be a developer I built like lots of stuff that redirect script bunch of things um the last three things I built I would have estimated well let's just take one uh I would have estimated 12 to 14 hours for me to like sit down code that get everything trouble so it work took me 45 minutes like four revisions which CH GPT and I had working code uh is that the best no does it work yes it can be slow it may not handle like large data sets but just as a proof of concept or if you got time to wait it's amazing so anyone with an idea can now just run with it everyone in this room is probably going to have like 50 bajillion ideas and you can just go build the thing now it's amazing it's like instant notifications basically you know fa talked about index now like we're going to we're literally using that it's going to be basically you make a change on the page it notifies index now that notifies us we go crawl the page like seconds later then we can tell you if you screwed something up literally seconds after that W but what do you do with that like there just yeah faster notifications whatever uh Cloud flare workers or job JavaScript JavaScript has better support Cloud flare workers really cool let you change all the code on the page before it's ever served to bots are users can youall see where I'm going with this yet there's a thing that got titled Edge SEO by a guy named uh Dan Taylor I still argue it should be serverless SEO that's okay it's okay it's okay uh you can automate practically everything uh I'm I'm actually convinced uh that about 95% of tech SEO issues all those things I don't care about imagine having a system that's just like here are all these things that you're never going to assign anyone to fix click a button say I want to fix those it's a lot of AI scripts and stuff that you could literally automate like oh I need to like do 20,000 meta descriptions okay like let me give an intern like 2 months or let me click a button 2 minutes later the AI is done click a button boom implemented I got 10,000 Pages marked no index oh I should be index click a button indexed we are there we've been there for years this has been possible we have a system coming that's going to do this by the way it's called patches it's going to be awesome so I have some ideas about what is actually next we can talk about that if y'all want yeah you do no then I'm going to do it no we'll talk after over drinks over drinks we'll talk no it's uh there's a lot of creative people in this room there's a lot of creative people in our industry I'm really excited to see what the what we're going to come up with what the next generation is going to come up with it really is exciting times I hope y'all had a really good time at the conference that your mind has been expanded that you got some new ideas and I want to thank you all for coming here really really appreciate it [Applause]",

        "raw_text": "hello one all right uh yeah that was the intro when is cloaking a good idea well Google's not here anymore so uh we can actually get going with this and uh this stays here right it's not live streamed wait it is it's okay because this might have happened 5 years ago uh there we go all right so uh yeah cloaking it can actually improve your SEO uh and just like any other medical ad in the United States or New Zealand as the other country that actually allows this I have to caveat all this side effects that you might have when you cloak especially if you're caught by Google doing any of these things does is not officially sanctioned by Google in any ways but just something that might have happened around 5 years ago for some B2B SAS company that I might have been working at cool all right so uh yeah we already had an intro we can skip that uh that's the mass thing that's actually a Kendo uh Menan I do Kendo which is Japanese SW fighting that's actually how I met my wife but that's another story altogether uh yeah that's the rough agenda that I'm not really following but if you want to get a sense of that that's what's I'm going to talk about and it all started a long long time ago about fiveish years ago there's this like crazy slack Channel that's really secretive only for certain people inevitably some guy or gal in support will find it and we have to boot them out but really what we were having an issue there was gdpr and everyone one is impacted by gdpr everyone has to put cookie consent on their websites and back then we're like oh that should be no issue right like we really measure uh impact by uh whether or not someone has signed up for HubSpot or if they asked for some sort of action and what we learned was that was not consent so if you signed up and became like a free customer cust or a free user but you actually denied cooking consent that would break our attribution and guess what I don't think this is actually going to get any better and that's why I felt like this was a this would be a great talk to talk about right so again if you think about gaing people from uh accessing content or doing anything like cor does like hey you want to read more all that and getting it like you you don't get any of that data unless you accept that cookie it's direct so uh yeah gdpr impacts everyone here because you don't know where a EU citizen may be searching for so originally we were like ah we'll just go to search console we'll see like what the traffic is in all these countries and then we'll get a rough estimate of the impact just don't do it there's no point like everyone's impacted right like you just don't know where these uh lawsuits and number of fines might come from and originally the thought back then was like well are they really going to enforce it how are they going to enforce it well it's going up and obligatory uh I'm not a lawyer but you know so uh what did we discover when we started enabling cookie tracking and making sure that we actually don't track the people that denied consent one of these countries rejected consent and stop showing analytics is it Germany France Japan United States and the answer is Germany over half the visitors just want nothing to do with cooking scent and so the German team was really scared because that's how we figure out everything in our business via attribution and so that conversion Source was about to be not provided right for that whole team and if you've been been in SEO long enough you know that phase is really scary but of course AI can solve all of Humanity's problems right conversion modeling from ga4 so what do they do AI goes in sees direct and says oh some of that direct goes to these other buckets okay do you believe that what if their AI model improves does that data backtrack do you see the problem here you don't control that right and so that was our main concern you need to be able to know you know what's generating money for your business and Heck if they roll back something or do something like we don't control that so this is what actually happened we added a last touch attribution script in JavaScript that would append in internal parameters in our links so you know that golden advice in SEO saying don't ever hardcode UTM parameters in your internal links well oops uh we created a new parameter and we're hardcoding it in Via JavaScript what could go wrong well I'm going to highlight two things uh number one why do we have to do this well because at where I work everything goes down to the dollar money um value everyone knows uh why the work we do is valuable and so it all starts with understanding the searches people make how those searches are tied to the products we sell how many of those PE of those Searchers Is it feasible for us to actually Rank and get traffic from how in an organic channel do they convert and then in that conversion uh type whether it's a lead they uh an offer they download a demo they request for a sales rep or a free account they create you know of those people then towards the end how much money will they actually pay to us right and so you can throw some hypothetical numbers here maybe you did a bunch of keyword research you got to a uh 100 million and then you're like oh I can only capture 1% of that and uh our conversion rate suck so it's % and maybe uh a person booking a demo actually becoming a paid customer is 10% uh and if we sell something that expensive that's maybe like $1,000 a month all of a sudden you're generating $1 million a month and wow if you are someone thinking about how do I get that promotion how do I create a team for more headcount really understanding your business and mapping this golden PA of triangle however we want to invert it doesn't matter is really important and again why are we highlighing these two numbers in yellow those are the parts that I said we cared about that last touch attribution that we were not seeding control over to Google that we went to very far deps to control and do last touch attribution right all right so what could go wrong more craw better ranking right we just had that question uh so we got about 212 million requests maybe maybe that happened maybe this was only one cctld maybe what could go wrong well uh let's just say product was like what the is SEO doing uh and then SEO was just like we weren't actually in this meeting at all this was decided by another team and so uh fortunately maybe back then we might have shared some infrastructure with our customers and that's why it's like a critical situation that we remedy this and so uh other things started cropping that that was very stupid um interesting uh so these parameters were showing up on other people's websites not even related to us so up here I'll just read it out Department of Labor Google Salesforce Microsoft like I I don't I have no idea how these started showing up in other people's sites as duplicate content that is indexed on the web but that happened so shortterm throwback uh this might have happened a long time ago right so we had the parameter handling tool that is you know rest in peace 2022 uh and we had about 300ish that we said why might as well tackle that while we're here instead of the seven that I just listed and just to appease the product team we're like hey let's crawl limits Google Bots and uh make sure our customers are taken care of because that's always our prime directive uh yeah good riddance uh crawl parameter tool didn't use it's like useless basically it's not very effective uh again we looked at our log files and we're just like hey I thought I told Google just to ignore it CU it doesn't really change the content at all so what was the big fix it was actually just to block googlebot from executing the JavaScript that was appending parameters and you know as a good SEO will do is when you have a crisis don't waste it you have resources to investigate other things that are weird and shouldn't happen you might as well go ahead and Tackle those too so uh yeah you're like what's IP lookup well uh that's something that we do in our CMS where we based off of your IP address might personalize uh the content on your page we call that smart content does googlebot care about that should he even try to load that it doesn't need to oh okay let's just block it uh yeah so we started actually from all those crawls to get up to 200 to one duplicates and then over time that go close to 20 to1 and you know there's it's it was a big win back then of things we were worried about uh but again there's a lot of room for improvement because once you start going down this Rabbit Hole of like wait I can block googlebot and basically be cloaking and when a person sees you know all that long parameter to that and then Google just sees one without a parameter and we didn't get a manual penalty from this right right like hm why stop here so if you're doing Dynamic rendering right you're like okay if users don't need schema open graft data and other meta metadata for Bots why are we loading it for them like you could improve your web core vital there right or maybe like you know Bots don't execute non- rening scripts so if you have ad tracking uh heat Maps tag manager uh I'll leave a testing out of this for now cuz that's still technically cloaking they have a lot of really strict guidelines there but I'm personally in the belief that they might as well make it simpler and just say hey we can just totally block Google bot from uh any AV testing platforms uh but uh last but not least another thing you can think about with this whole concept is if you're doing stuff on the edge if you have parameterizations that you know that correctly canonicalize to a parameterless URL why are we wasting all this time for Google to visit the URL render the whole thing and go like hm yeah we'll uh canonicalize to the parameter lless one why don't we just instead of a strong hint strong arm Google and saying that's a 301 saves everyone some time right and that last one I haven't done yet caveat caveat caveat but if you've already done that I'd love to from you so uh yeah this is the most boring slide that I have right uh so it's a good idea to cloak when what you're serving users is essentially the same as uh what search Eng get in spirit right they kind of give you a pass for that and then you should only do this when you can actually get credit from this right like whether it's cost savings with the producting like most people don't really get assigned to that like J was just saying like oh the bites it's like it's a large number it doesn't matter I was like well if you can make it matter and you know claim credit for it then it's a good thing for your career right um so maybe reducing server costs or maybe there's Engineers you want to work with that are gold on that and you want to build that relationship those are things to look into and if your workplace cares about sustainability less wasted bites on the wire just make the world a better place right so last but not least a little bit more controversial you know when it's personalization it's not really cloaking and Google's good with that right so that's another angle to look at it with you know if you have cookies or if you don't for personalization and some cases location and again tons of caveats here so uh should you even care about my presentation well if this is your crawl stats report and you see like a trillion there or I think that's a trillion yeah okay I don't know what comes after T is it a q an s or G but uh if that is what your crawl stats looks like then I think you should really try to save some trees right like just have Google bot not crawl uh your Google tag manager and maybe you've already saved a th trees just saying right and again it's it's some pretty rough SEO math here that I'm facing this off of but whatever that bite differential It Is by going to the site of like hey they had to crawl this with all these scripts versus without that's kind of the difference that you can then bring over to teams and again if your company mission statement has you know offsetting CO2 emissions and all that this is a perfect site and again hat tip here to arnout Helman uh for uh sharing another deck he's worked on and again he deeply cares about performance and the impact on sustainability uh another one here on the note of personalization uh why resize images like in your personal devices and then have that load really slowly when you could just do that on the edge right and Jon o here has his own gith head Rebo of this where you can really if you're on both WordPress and have Cloud flare uh paid account that you can serve the exact image dimensions for the user versus having the user load the images and then have to resize it so this will help your cor web vital it'll save the environment a little bit and again this is personalization it's not really cloaking so there's a lot of smart things we can do when we really think about like what we serve people versus what we serve search engines and do we really need to serve all this junk to search engines so yeah cloaking right now as it's defined in search console is the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users so again the good definition is we're not misleading users and if your technology uh if site uses Technologies and search engines have difficulty accessing JavaScript images they have recommendations right on what to use uh I doctored this slly there's some examples in between but what I would propose like you know maybe you know we can say there's cloaking it's still different content for users and search engines but when we're doing this to save resources right without misleading users it's a great idea uh we're on YouTube right so I can't swear I can't monetize thiswear do it yeah it's a great idea guys and you know I I'm I'm kind of just being kind of subtle about this because I don't want to wake up the next day and I have like a manual penalty and waiting in my inbox but uh again if your site is using Technologies that's difficult for search engines like JavaScript generating parameters or like you have tracking pixels from ads that you Google really shouldn't care like then you know follow some recommendations for reducing any kind of unnecessary data transfers by cloaking like that should just be a good thing for everyone hopefully right so again uh thank [Applause] you and",

just saying right and again its its some pretty rough seo math here that im facing this off of but whatever that bite differential it is by going to the site of like hey they had to crawl this with all these scripts versus without thats kind of the difference that you can then bring over to teams and again if your company mission statement has you know offsetting co2 emissions and all that this is a perfect site and again hat tip here to arnout helman uh for uh sharing another deck hes worked on and again he deeply cares about performance and the impact on sustainability uh another one here on the note of personalization uh why resize images like in your personal devices and then have that load really slowly when you could just do that on the edge right and jon o here has his own gith head rebo of this where you can really if youre on both wordpress and have cloud flare uh paid account that you can serve the exact image dimensions for the user versus having the user load the images and then have to resize it so this will help your cor web vital itll save the environment a little bit and again this is personalization its not really cloaking so theres a lot of smart things we can do when we really think about like what we serve people versus what we serve search engines and do we really need to serve all this junk to search engines so yeah cloaking right now as its defined in search console is the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users so again the good definition is were not misleading users and if your technology uh if site uses technologies and search engines have difficulty accessing javascript images they have recommendations right on what to use uh i doctored this slly theres some examples in between but what i would propose like you know maybe you know we can say theres cloaking its still different content for users and search engines but when were doing this to save resources right without misleading users its a great idea uh were on youtube right so i cant swear i cant monetize thiswear do it yeah its a great idea guys and you know i im im kind of just being kind of subtle about this because i dont want to wake up the next day and i have like a manual penalty and waiting in my inbox but uh again if your site is using technologies thats difficult for search engines like javascript generating parameters or like you have tracking pixels from ads that you google really shouldnt care like then you know follow some recommendations for reducing any kind of unnecessary data transfers by cloaking like that should just be a good thing for everyone hopefully right so again uh thank applause you and",

        "raw_text": "[Applause] hey everybody thank you all right so I'm really happy to be here thank you for having me it's true there's a chrome guy at an SEO conference I didn't get lost on my way here so my team is responsible for maintaining all of the documentation and best press best practices around the metrics tools and apis to help make the web faster and that includes all of you in the SEO community because web performance and SEO have one very important thing in common and of course that's the core web vitals thanks entirely to the page experience ranking signal in Google search so I got to see that firsthand earlier this year when we launched interaction to next paint as the new core web vital metric replacing first input delay as I was monitoring the launch I couldn't help but notice all of the support from the SEO Community Helping to raise awareness about the launch and also all of the best practices to improve this new and unfamiliar metric and when we look at the data I really do think that that had a immensely positive effect on inp Pass rates so in the months leading up to and after that launch we we've seen inp go from something like 65% of sites having good inpp on mobile to now it's more like 76% so thank you all for your help with that also the fact that you're having me here speaking to you today I am so grateful for the opportunity and also so that we can explore some of the Common Ground that we have between the web performance and SEO communities while the core web vitals and Page experience signal may very well just be one small part of the ranking Factor there are so many more reasons to care about web performance so what I hope to convince you all of today is that your efforts to improve core web vitals will have an that goes well beyond SEO one of the most illustrative examples I could give you about the value of web performance is the story of project feather in December 2009 Chris Zacharias was working as an engineer at YouTube when he got fed up with how heavy the video watch page had gotten it was over 12200 kilobytes and his goal was to make it under 100 k kilobytes he named the project feather he managed to get most of the way there by cutting down on just just down to that core functionality of the page just the video player only a few comments and only a few of those recommended videos in the sidebar and you might also remember that back then videos were played using the Flash Player but just a few months earlier the HTML 5 video player had launched and he switched over to that player finally getting him down to just 98 kilobytes so he finally met his goal and feather was ready for live traffic he wrote up a blog post invited people to start using it and his hypothesis like any reasonable person would expect was that a lighter watch page would lead to faster experiences well about a week later he looked at the data and he was wrong performance had actually gotten worse and as he wrote in a Blog post a few years later my worldview was shattered nothing made sense so the results only started to make sense when a colleague thought to slice the data by geography what he found was a disproportionate increase from users in places that you would tend to think of as having poorer connectivity or lower-end devices for these users it took extra more like 2 minutes to load this feather watch page which doesn't make sense until you look at their experience on the default watch page which was more like 20 minutes so to them this new experience was so much better proving that performance is relative you can go from having a slow experience to a slightly less slow experience and it would still deliver an immense value to the users so Chris's experiment suffered from sampling bias but but the thing I want you to take away from this is not how to properly set up an AB test the thing about feather is that it lowered the barrier to entry for users in this case performance was more like an enabling feature the same way that accessibility is and I know that YouTube is kind of a special example it's the most popular video website on the web and not everybody can just throw away 90% of your page weight as an experiment so let's look at another case study Sunday citizen they're an e-commerce site that specializes in bedding for the home Vice called them the goat of weighted blankets for what that's worth and a couple of years ago they collaborated with Shopify to improve their web performance and I'm just speculating here but I think it went something like this they noticed that their core web vitals were not as good as they had hoped and they reached out to the Shopify team to find out is it something on their end or is it something on the platform's end and so the Shopify team took a look and after some investigation they found a few opportunities for improvement and if I'm being honest there was nothing groundbreaking here they didn't have to rearchitecturing blocking CSS JavaScript and fonts they made the LCP image more discoverable by taking out of CSS from a background image just to a plain old HTML image tag and they made sure not to Lazy load it instead they added the fetch priority equals High attribute to prioritize it and they also made some improvements to layout stability by reserving space for contents that shift layout on the page and as straightforward as these changes were they saw a 25% Improvement to their LCP and a 61% Improvement to their CLS layout stability metric but that's not the end of the story when they looked at their business metrics they saw a 4% decrease in bounce rate a 4% increase in ad to cart and a 6% increase in their conversion rate and if you looked at their revenue and reported that data I'm sure that went up too so this is another really great case study to show that there are effects on improving performance that go Way Beyond just SEO and getting people onto the site it's about keeping users on the site and making them happy because happier users will deliver more value for the site in terms of business metrics so the ways that YouTube and Sunday citizen improved their web performance followed some pretty basic web performance best practices and as it turns out the Chrome team has established what we've determined to be the most effective best practices for improving core web vitals so now i' like like to change gears a bit and look at each of the core of vital metrics and the most effective ways to improve them but first I need to confess something to you all I'm a chrome guy in a room full of SEO experts and I'm feeling very judged with my headings on my slides it's very basic stuff so there we go that's much better so I present to you the nine ways to boost your web performance speed in 2024 The Ultimate Guide to core web vitals near me let me know if I'm doing this right all right so let's start with LCP largest content full paint I think most of you are familiar with the metric can I see a show of hands who knows about LCP all right I'm going to skip over the basic stuff but I do want to go into a bit of detail because LCP happens to be the metric that the fewest websites have good scores on so I'm going to spend a little bit more time on this looking at a few special considerations how to measure it and then we'll get into the most effective ways to improve it so LCP like you all know it's the largest piece of content on the page it's important to remember though that there maybe multiple LCP candidates as you go through the page load usually text is the first thing to appear so maybe something like your H1 element is going to be the initial LCP candidate and then you have something like a hero image pop onto the page that's the new LCP candidate but what you also need to keep in mind is that the LCP met metric stops measuring after the first user interaction so you can imagine if a user clicks or Scrolls or Types on the keyboard after that first H1 that's the final LCP candidate so you might see different metrics depending on how the users behave there's also some types of content that does not count as the LCP the first being background images like full screen background images so these are things that the user would tend to consider more like uh decorative than content so it doesn't count the second thing is invisible content if this is kind of is straightforward if the user can't see it it doesn't count as content but there's a gotcha here that sometimes content fades in and what LCP is looking at is the initial opacity of that content so even if it fades up from zero the fact that it was initially zero makes it not an LCP candidate and the third thing is placeholders like image placeholders the gray boxes that you see as image are loading this is great for layout stability but again this is not content it does not count as the LCP it's also a bit complicated because the biggest piece of content for you might be totally different for someone else so the most dramatic example of this is somebody on a very wide desktop screen and somebody on a very narrow Mobile screen they're going to get different types of LCP contents maybe on a large desktop screen wide images that are in landscape mode count as the biggest content but as you shrink that screen size smaller and smaller now it's responsive and it takes up a relatively smaller proportion of the screen but at the same time maybe you have paragraphs of text or a heading now it starts to wrap onto more lines so now the area of that content is larger than the image making it the LCP candidate for that page also web applications are being built in ways that the standardization groups had never anticipated so on a traditional website each navigation requires a new HTML resource to render the next page and then each page view starts from scratch it resets the per performance timeline and then you get new LCP elements however single page applications or SAS they're all about reusing existing contents on the page updating only what has changed so as you navigate to a new page instead of discarding that old page and getting entirely new HTM you keep the skeleton of the page around and dynamically swap in those new contents but the problem is that the performance timeline is going to keep ticking the LCP element already happened earlier in that session you do not get a new value so as a consequence of that there's only one LCP value for the entire session on that LCP site and the Chrome team is aware of this uh it's a pretty big blind spot in core web vitals especially considering how popular Spas have become uh we are experimenting with a couple of origin trials to fix this uh but the important thing to remember for now is that Spas are measured differently in core web vitals so if you've ever used the performance panel in Chrome Dev tools you've seen something like this if you're not familiar with it this is the trace View and we're looking at the network track showing you the order and the timing of resource loading in what's known as a waterfall diagram and using this view you can more easily see how resources can actually depend on each other but I'm going to provide a simpler version of this just to go through a few examples for uh different LCP Concepts in these diagrams each resource is colorcoded where you have blue for HTML purple for CSS green for images like the LCP image orange for JavaScript and red for fonts so using this diagram let's look at a hypothetical LCP and see why it might be slow the best way to do that is to break it up into phases and there are four phases for LCP they never overlap and between them they account for every single mill second of the LCP time each phase is also defined so that if one of them is the slowest that gives you a clue as to what the problem might be and also what the potential fixes for that could be and the first phase is time to first bite or ttfb some people might think of this as the backend time or the server think time ttfb also accounts for all of the time just to get to the server so this is all the networking stuff that happens along the way like redirects resolving DNS negotiating TCP or SSL and you could if you needed also break the ttfb time down into these subphases to get a better look so that brings us to the number one most effective way to improve core web vitals and that is to aim for instant navigations because the absolute best way to improve ttfb and LCP as a whole is to be completely 100% independent from Network requests so there are two ways to achieve instant navigations Restorations and speculations you can think of them like optimizing based on where a user has already been and where they're about to go a restoration takes a page that has already been loaded and already been rendered and it serves it back to the user upon request in its already rendered state from cache and a speculation takes a page that we think a user is about to navigate to and it prefetches and pre- renders that in the background history Restorations are made possible by the browser's back forward cache or BF cache you can think of it like taking a snapshot of the page as soon as the user navigates away storing it locally in memory for later and if the user eventually clicks back or forward to return to that page the browser can simply paint the same pixels back onto the screen exactly where the user left them so this is kind of a huge deal because one in five navigations on mobile are back forward and we know that mobile experiences are much worse than desktop so this is a great opportunity to flip some slow experiences to instant ones and the second trick to instant navigations is to speculatively pre-render the next page that a user is about to visit and this is made possible with the speculation rules API it's available now in chromium based browsers a speculation rule is an instruction to the browser that says which links to pre-render and when you do need to be kind of strategic about this though because there are limitations to how many pre- renders you can have at any given time so the best way that you can uh make sure that you pre render the most likely page or user is about to visit is to look at your analytics take that one link and uh eagerly pre-render it on the page something else to watch out for that causes slow ttfb is redirects the problem with redirects is that each one of them is an extra unnecessary hop before arriving at the final content a user might be redirected from HTTP to https or example to www.example.com or if the content has moved they go from SL old to slne even external link shorteners like bitly and Twitter's t.co they actually work by introducing redirects so they slow the page down the way to mitigate this is to ensure that the content the links point actually directly to that final URL that the user is going to visit whenever possible it's not always possible but the best way to find out if your site has a problem with redirects is to measure it and I'll get back to measuring in a little bit later for now though our second most effective way to improve core web vitals is to use a CDN CDN are content delivery networks which means that they have a fleet of edge servers all around the world and by moving resources physically closer to your users requests can be handled much more quickly CDN also make it easier to enable other performance features at scale like caching compression and also the latest versions of the networking protocols like HTTP and TLS and one CDN in particular Cloud flare actually just introduced a service last month called speed brain and that adds speculative pre-rendering to all sites on their free plan so by using a CDN you can attack performance from lots of different angles the second LCP phase is the time from ttfb to the start of the Quest for the LCB resource which is called the resource load delay this phase only applies to image or video-based LCP elements um text based LCP elements aren't associated with external resources so in those cases this phase is set to zero the third most effective way to improve core web vitals actually has two parts the first one is about discoverability remember from the case study with Sunday citizen where the LCP Source was hidden away in uh CSS 5 as a background image well that has a couple of really negative effects on performance so for one thing the browser has no idea that the image even exists until it loads and parses the stylesheet so there's no way for it to preload the image you could declaratively preload that image manually using something like a link tag but even if you do that you'll run into the second problem which is that the stylesheet is still the bottleneck the browser has nowhere to put that image even if it's already loaded until the CSS tells it to make it the background image for some element on the page also for what it's worth client side rendering on the initial page load basically has the same issues except it's JavaScript as the intermediary instead of CSS but the solution in both of these problems is exactly what Shopify and Sunday citizen did just moving it out of the CSS and into the HTML using a basic image tag it really is that simple another performance issue related to discoverability is lazy loading the loading equals lazy attribute is LCP poison do not use it it is bad it prevents the browser from eagerly loading the image as early as it could because it first needs to make sure that the image will appear within the viewport and that's not always a quick process maybe the only thing worse than loading equals lazy is the data source attribute because that's an indicator of a custom solution built in JavaScript and custom Solutions are strictly slower than native ones and just to be clear lazy loading is good you should use it but only for Content that's below the fold only for Content that's not critical the LCP element is by definition critical so it should never be lazy loaded all right so I said this was a two-parter and part two is about prioritization even if the image is discoverable in the HTML it still might not load as early as it could if there are lots of other higher priority resources on the page Chrome assigns images a default priority of low and for the first five images it bumps it up to medium but if you have critical render blocking static content like CSS JavaScript fonts those have high priority so you could actually be competing with those resources for Network the fetch priority equals High attribute hints to the browser to raise the default priority up to high for these images so it can start loading much sooner all right now we're on LCP phase number three resource load duration this one is also only applicable to LCP external resources like images and videos it measures how long the resource takes to load from start to finish and because LCP is measuring the time for an image to appear it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that the image's download time is is usually the bottleneck and so when talking about LCP optimization it's easy to jump straight into the things that make the image load more quickly and we'll get to those things in a second but I did want to take this opportunity to share some of the important data that my team has just published recently on the most common LCP bottlenecks in August my colleague Brendan Kenny published a blog post titled common misconceptions about how to optimize LCP the URL is in the corner of the slide I also have a QR code at the end so I think this chart sums it up pretty well let me walk you through it uh for every website in the Chrome user experience report we looked at their uh it's not yet public we looked at their data on the four LCP phases we aggregated these phase distributions by taking their 75th percentile and then aggregated those stats over all 19 or so million websites in the data set by taking the median value of each of those so so it it's a distribution of distributions it's kind of mindbending I know uh we did that three times for websites having origin level LCP performance of good needs Improvement and poor so you can look at this chart and see which phases sites tend to struggle with the most depending on their LCP performance and interestingly you'll find that resource load duration which is represented by the green bar here is always the fastest phase it does gets slower as LCP gets worse but it's still far from the bottleneck this data is not saying that you never need to worry about image optimization but maybe what we can take away from this is that images already tend to be optimized well enough that there are other higher priority things that you should be focusing on to improve your LCP the phases that actually seem to be most worrisome at least to me are ttfb in blue and resource load delay in red and that's why all three of the most effective ways to improve LCP so far have been attributed to those phases that's where websites have the most to gain all right so let's say you're one of the few sites that does have terrible resource load duration how do you fix it I think you all have heard these answers a hundred times before so we'll just Breeze right through this so you should try using a modern image format like webp or avif to reduce that file size it's going to speed up the download time as a result and and webp tends to be about 30% smaller than comparable jpeg or PNG images you can also reduce the file size by decreasing the image quality by a lot you don't need to save everything at 100% quality when the human eye can't even tell the difference between that and 80% you can also scale the images down to avoid wasting bites on pixels that never get rendered to the user so even if the image itself is small there are still some things that you can do to shorten the time it takes to go to the server and back the best way to do that is to set a long cache Lifetime on your images assuming that they rarely change so then on repeat visits users users can just reuse what they've already had in cach and that eliminates that Network request entirely the other thing that you can do to avoid extra connection setup costs is hosting the image on the same domain as your HTML resource the same things that slow down ttfb can also slow down this image request you won't need to pay those costs if you use the connections that are already open now we're at the fourth and final LCP phase which is element render delay when there's an LCP resource the render delay is measured from the time that the resource is done loading to the time that the resource is finally displayed to the user and when the element is text the render delay starts directly from the ttfb time so as a quick recap of what I've already already mentioned before attempts to minimize the load delay phase might end up Shifting the problem to the render delay phase with pre-loading things like CSS background images client side rendering or lazy loading can continue to delay that LCP time in the form of render delay no matter how early you've pre-loaded that image so this is one of the few text-based LCP specific things to know and it has to do with web fonts fonts are external resources web fonts specifically so they show up in the waterfall diagram but they're not considered to be an LCP resource so the render delay and uh loading duration phases do not actually apply the reason why web fonts matter to LCP has to do with the fact that LCP candidates change over time so let's say that your initial LCP is an H1 element and then your super cool custom web font loads a few seconds later if that web font changes the geometry of the text and bumps the size up just a little bit that is going to be the new LCP candidate several seconds later so it could hurt your performance the best fix for this is to ensure that the system font that's initially shown has a similar size to the custom web font and you can do that with the size adjust CSS property there are also ways to speed up your web font so that it doesn't impact the LCP time as much so fonts should be cached for a long time a lot of these things are the same things that you can do for images cach them for a long time use better compression use modern image format or font formats like Waf 2 it's an industry standard and it's supported by all modern browsers you should also ideally self host your fonts eliminate that extra connection setup cost there are services like Google fonts and they do offer some Advanced uh font optimization strategies like subsetting you can say only load the glyphs in this font that are applicable to the characters that I display on this page like Latin or whatever you could also subset a font to specific characters if your heading says hello world you can only load those letters h e l l so finally the silent killer of LCP performance is slow JavaScript execution and we don't usually think of this as a loading performance issue but it definitely could be and I'm not talking about client side rendering either anything that blocks the main thread for an extended period of time delays the next opportunity to paint and if the LCB image is downloaded and ready to go all of this time will be attributed to its render DeLay So the solution to this is to break up your long tasks but that's exactly what I'm about to talk about in the next few slides for inpp so let's get right into it this is core vital number two interaction to next paint inp performs really well on desktop 97% of sites have good inp 76% of sites have good inp on mobile which is a little deceivingly High because uh if you look at only the top 1,000 most popular websites this number drops down to 63 now so there is definitely still a lot of room for improvement with inp despite the gains this is what a real interaction looks like in Chrome Dev tools the top is the interaction track and that shows that the user clicked on something probably uh creating pointer events and below that is all of the main thread activity during the interaction with each entry colorcoded and labeled according to the type of work that it did so again let's simplify this down the top part is the timing of the interaction using box and whiskers representing the three inp phases and the bottom part represents the main thread activity JS execution in Orange layout work in purple rendering and painting in green all right so using this diagram let's jump into the inp phases the left whisker represents the input delay phase this is what I uh first input delay used to measure that's measured from the moment that the user starts their interaction until the processing for that event can start the central box represents the processing duration this includes all of the time spent handling one or more of the events associated with the interaction like a pointer up and a click event of a tap interaction the right whisker represents the presentation delay this is everything that happens after the events have been processed until that frame is painted to the screen so the number four most effective way to improve core web vitals affects the input delay phase but it could also be just as impactful to the next phase as well and this is to avoid unnecessary JavaScript you can spend ages shaving milliseconds off of your runtime performance but it would be so much easier if you just throw that code away remember from the project feather story about The Tipping Point it came when Chris was able to replace the flash player with the native HTML 5 video player and thankfully we don't have to worry about Flash plugins anymore but we do have a ton of redundant JavaScript on our websites for things like libraries and polyfills and just for example CSS has gotten so incredibly powerful in recent years that things like animations could be done entirely scriptless you don't need to throw everything away either uh even if you just split your JavaScript bundles into things that you need to use now or use later then you can skip a lot of the time spent parsing and compiling unnecessary scripts number five is yielding to break up long tasks and this is listed under the processing phase but also it could be uh used to improve the input delay phase as well so so whenever JavaScript is taking a long time to do its work it's an opportunity to pause give the browser a chance to paint a frame and then go back and resume your work and this is a strategy known as yielding you do need to be a little bit judicious about when you yield ideally you should do all of the user visible work first and then ensure those changes are displayed to the user and for any follow-up work that's needed like uh lower priority background tasks maybe logging to analytics that stuff that can happen later if doing lots of little bits of work many times you could over yield maybe if you're iterating over a large array you don't want to have your yield statement in that array because there is a little bit of a overhead to seed control and then take it back and that could add up instead what you want to do is kind of keep track of how long you've been in the loop yield only if it's time to paint another frame so tasks should be kept to under 50 milliseconds and if you're a speed freak and you need to keep you know a 60 frame rate 60 FPS frame rate then 16 milliseconds is going to be your budget so if you're looking to yield there are a couple of apis in the scheduler API called yield and posttask they're available in chromium based browsers but for everybody else you can just use a simple set timeout and that'll usually do the trick during the presentation delay phase is the browser does all of the required style and layout work to get to the next frame ready to paint so number six is avoiding recurring or in avoid incurring large rendering updates however it's possible to incur expensive rendering work during the processing phase when it's forced by JavaScript code so you've probably heard this referred to as layout thrashing it happens when you modify a Dom element in one part of your code and then you try measuring it in a new part of your code this forces the browser to recalculate all of the styles that are necessary to measure that element and that takes time layout thrashing specifically refers to doing this lots and lots of times over lots of elements causing a chain of expensive rendering work that blocks the main thread so you can break that Chain by reorganizing your code so that your read operations happen before you modify the Dom and then any necessary style recalculation work can happen normally during that presentation phase routine rendering updates do normally occur during the presentation phase and there are also some things that you can do to minimize that time the first is to reduce the number of affected nodes that need to be repainted for example changing the class list on the body could invalidate the styles for all of the child elements on the page and that could be made even more expensive if you have expensive CSS selectors that take the browser a long time to figure out if a specific node is going to be affected by that change so to mitigate this you could simplify the selectors but the most effective thing is just to be to minimize the number of Dom elements on the page itself that leads to fewer elements to check and also faster style recalculation times another way to minimize rendering time is to lazily render contents that are off the screen using something called CSS containment the content visibility property just landed in Firefox earlier this year so now it is available across all modern browsers you can configure it to tell browsers to skip an elements layout style and paint work if it's not visible to the user and then when the element starts to come into view the browser can then resume its rendering work just in time all right the last metric is cumulative layout shift it's the best performing core web vital on the wild in the wild and also arguably the most straightforward to optimize it is kind of a strange performance metric in that it's not measured in terms of time it doesn't have any units at all and as a matter of fact we don't use it to uh we don't have any phases to break it down because it's unitless so for that reason we're just going to jump straight into the ways to optimize it with number seven reserving space for content by explicitly setting its Dimensions so for an image element you should know how big it's going to be and set its height and width accordingly otherwise if if uh the image has an initial height of zero pixels while the browser is waiting for it to load once that pops in that's going to shift the layout down causing a jarring user experience if you at least know what shape the content is going to be you can use the aspect ratio property in CSS and then you can dynamically size the content and in the worst case scenario if you have no idea what's about to happen you can at least reserve a little bit of space using the Min height or minwidth attributes there might still be a noticeable shift but at least it won't be as severe this one might come as a surprise but number eight is uh actually to take advantage of the BF cache which we've already talked about as an LCP optimization the reason why this is a game changer for CLS is because a significant amount of the layout shifts that happen actually occur during the initial page load so when you restore a page that's already been loaded and already been rendered any of those layout shifts will have already happened and so the new page view will appear much more stable but today the biggest blockers to BFC eligibility are uh listening to the unload event and also serving HTML Resources with the cache control no store header so finally number nine is to optimize CLS by avoiding layout inducing CSS properties in animations and transitions so for example if you want to slide a piece of content down you might be tempted to animate it's down property but even if the content is on its own layer changing the property actually triggers layout work the other directional properties like up left and right behave exactly the same way and the solution to this is use CSS properties that are animated by the compositor thread instead that means using things like transform translate why to move things and these types of animations do not incur any layout shifts all right we've covered the core web vitals themselves so I'd like to use whatever remaining time I have to talk about the data that goes behind it I think most of you are familiar with the Chrome user experience report or krux data set but I did want to highlight one really important distinction Crux Powers Chrome and search tools like page speit insights Dev tools search console it's Chrome's source of Truth for how fast or slow users are experiencing core web vitals it's an incredibly powerful data set but the kinds of questions that it's designed to answer are actually pretty simple like do 75% of the experiences meet the good threshold yes or no how about this metric or this form factor or this page it's not designed to answer the second most important question which is okay so why was it slow for that you need diagnostic tools Lighthouse is a diagnostic tool and it can point you in the right direction but it can't tell you why your users's experiences were slow it doesn't know how users access or behave on the page and it doesn't know what their LCP elements tend to be but these are all things that you can measure yourselves and the name for that is real user measurement or Rum this is something that each site will need to instrument themselves using a commercial rum product uh assuming they have core web vital support or some kind of homegrown solution but the data is worth its weight in gold because you can use it to understand why things are slow and how to reproduce them data is also really hard to argue with um you might recommend to a client that they should uh consider cleaning up some of their marketing tags uh the push back usually sounds something like but we need those well then you can come back to them with data to say uh such and such a tag typically adds 250 milliseconds to every click on the page and it's robbing you of a good inpp score well maybe they Chang their mind the other thing that's great about rum data is that you can measure the impact of your changes ideally with something like an AB test but even just watching the change over time is really really great uh krux data moves very slowly it's a 28 day aggregation but rum data on the other hand you can slice it any way you want uh and when you correlate that with other business business metrics in your analytics you can paint a really compelling picture about the impact that you're having and how valuable your work is just to give you idea of what's possible and this is using all free Google tools this is a dashboard that I built to diagnose inp issues on our web.dev website it uses the attribution build of the open source web vitals JS library to measure the user experiences and get diagnostic data about it I send that off to Google analytics using custom events I process all of that data on big query and I visualize it in looker studio so for example I can use this data to track inp performance across the entire site or groups of pages I plot it out over time or as a full distribution and I can drill down into the most popular and problematic areas in this case it looks like the learn pages are especially slow so I can explore the inp phases to see where the time is spent and what is causing it to be slow I know it's hard to draw any kind of conclusion from this at a glance but uh this data did help me understand that there was something other than script processing time that was slowing down interactions the input and presentation delay phases were much slower so I dug deeper into what users were interacting with and when I found that the most common interactions were kind of confusing users were just clicking on text uh that's not very interactive but something was still causing that to be slow so the dashboard gave me all of the information I needed to build a reproducible test case so I could figure it out locally in Dev tools so I loaded up the page I started to trace I clicked on the heading text and here's what I found and just like in the rum data there was a relatively quick processing duration with those long whiskers extending outward indicating a slow input delay and presentation delay phases there seemed to be a lot of expensive style recalculation work happening and Dev tools helped me trace it back to animating Spinners I hope this video loads yes so I thought that was really weird because I didn't see any Spinners on the page but sure enough they were still there animating away in fact I found 31 spinner components on the page all stuck in an infinite Loop and the problem was that despite being hidden hidden the animations were not paused pausing the animations was a simple enough fix so we pushed it live and we immediately saw a 25% Improvement to our mobile imp across the learn pages so we still have more work to do getting our inp closer to the green but we are making progress and it wouldn't be possible without rum data to to guide the way so while it's true that all of you in the SEO Community are focused on succeeding in search we're still very closely aligned with our goals with the web performance Community to improve core web vitals I hope I was able to show you that web performance I hope was able to show you web performance in a slightly different light uh and also how your work to improve core web vitals improves the speed of the web as a whole I also hope that you take these things that you've learned about core web vital metrics and the most effective ways to diagnose and optimize them and you do what you do best share it with the community and apply it in practice to help make an even faster web thank [Applause] you g i more time [Applause]",
        "cleaned_text": "applause hey everybody thank you all right so im really happy to be here thank you for having me its true theres a chrome guy at an seo conference i didnt get lost on my way here so my team is responsible for maintaining all of the documentation and best press best practices around the metrics tools and apis to help make the web faster and that includes all of you in the seo community because web performance and seo have one very important thing in common and of course thats the core web vitals thanks entirely to the page experience ranking signal in google search so i got to see that firsthand earlier this year when we launched interaction to next paint as the new core web vital metric replacing first input delay as i was monitoring the launch i couldnt help but notice all of the support from the seo community helping to raise awareness about the launch and also all of the best practices to improve this new and unfamiliar metric and when we look at the data i really do think that that had a immensely positive effect on inp pass rates so in the months leading up to and after that launch we weve seen inp go from something like 65 of sites having good inpp on mobile to now its more like 76 so thank you all for your help with that also the fact that youre having me here speaking to you today i am so grateful for the opportunity and also so that we can explore some of the common ground that we have between the web performance and seo communities while the core web vitals and page experience signal may very well just be one small part of the ranking factor there are so many more reasons to care about web performance so what i hope to convince you all of today is that your efforts to improve core web vitals will have an that goes well beyond seo one of the most illustrative examples i could give you about the value of web performance is the story of project feather in december 2009 chris zacharias was working as an engineer at youtube when he got fed up with how heavy the video watch page had gotten it was over 12200 kilobytes and his goal was to make it under 100 k kilobytes he named the project feather he managed to get most of the way there by cutting down on just just down to that core functionality of the page just the video player only a few comments and only a few of those recommended videos in the sidebar and you might also remember that back then videos were played using the flash player but just a few months earlier the html 5 video player had launched and he switched over to that player finally getting him down to just 98 kilobytes so he finally met his goal and feather was ready for live traffic he wrote up a blog post invited people to start using it and his hypothesis like any reasonable person would expect was that a lighter watch page would lead to faster experiences well about a week later he looked at the data and he was wrong performance had actually gotten worse and as he wrote in a blog post a few years later my worldview was shattered nothing made sense so the results only started to make sense when a colleague thought to slice the data by geography what he found was a disproportionate increase from users in places that you would tend to think of as having poorer connectivity or lowerend devices for these users it took extra more like 2 minutes to load this feather watch page which doesnt make sense until you look at their experience on the default watch page which was more like 20 minutes so to them this new experience was so much better proving that performance is relative you can go from having a slow experience to a slightly less slow experience and it would still deliver an immense value to the users so chriss experiment suffered from sampling bias but but the thing i want you to take away from this is not how to properly set up an ab test the thing about feather is that it lowered the barrier to entry for users in this case performance was more like an enabling feature the same way that accessibility is and i know that youtube is kind of a special example its the most popular video website on the web and not everybody can just throw away 90 of your page weight as an experiment so lets look at another case study sunday citizen theyre an ecommerce site that specializes in bedding for the home vice called them the goat of weighted blankets for what thats worth and a couple of years ago they collaborated with shopify to improve their web performance and im just speculating here but i think it went something like this they noticed that their core web vitals were not as good as they had hoped and they reached out to the shopify team to find out is it something on their end or is it something on the platforms end and so the shopify team took a look and after some investigation they found a few opportunities for improvement and if im being honest there was nothing groundbreaking here they didnt have to rearchitecturing blocking css javascript and fonts they made the lcp image more discoverable by taking out of css from a background image just to a plain old html image tag and they made sure not to lazy load it instead they added the fetch priority equals high attribute to prioritize it and they also made some improvements to layout stability by reserving space for contents that shift layout on the page and as straightforward as these changes were they saw a 25 improvement to their lcp and a 61 improvement to their cls layout stability metric but thats not the end of the story when they looked at their business metrics they saw a 4 decrease in bounce rate a 4 increase in ad to cart and a 6 increase in their conversion rate and if you looked at their revenue and reported that data im sure that went up too so this is another really great case study to show that there are effects on improving performance that go way beyond just seo and getting people onto the site its about keeping users on the site and making them happy because happier users will deliver more value for the site in terms of business metrics so the ways that youtube and sunday citizen improved their web performance followed some pretty basic web performance best practices and as it turns out the chrome team has established what weve determined to be the most effective best practices for improving core web vitals so now i like like to change gears a bit and look at each of the core of vital metrics and the most effective ways to improve them but first i need to confess something to you all im a chrome guy in a room full of seo experts and im feeling very judged with my headings on my slides its very basic stuff so there we go thats much better so i present to you the nine ways to boost your web performance speed in 2024 the ultimate guide to core web vitals near me let me know if im doing this right all right so lets start with lcp largest content full paint i think most of you are familiar with the metric can i see a show of hands who knows about lcp all right im going to skip over the basic stuff but i do want to go into a bit of detail because lcp happens to be the metric that the fewest websites have good scores on so im going to spend a little bit more time on this looking at a few special considerations how to measure it and then well get into the most effective ways to improve it so lcp like you all know its the largest piece of content on the page its important to remember though that there maybe multiple lcp candidates as you go through the page load usually text is the first thing to appear so maybe something like your h1 element is going to be the initial lcp candidate and then you have something like a hero image pop onto the page thats the new lcp candidate but what you also need to keep in mind is that the lcp met metric stops measuring after the first user interaction so you can imagine if a user clicks or scrolls or types on the keyboard after that first h1 thats the final lcp candidate so you might see different metrics depending on how the users behave theres also some types of content that does not count as the lcp the first being background images like full screen background images so these are things that the user would tend to consider more like uh decorative than content so it doesnt count the second thing is invisible content if this is kind of is straightforward if the user cant see it it doesnt count as content but theres a gotcha here that sometimes content fades in and what lcp is looking at is the initial opacity of that content so even if it fades up from zero the fact that it was initially zero makes it not an lcp candidate and the third thing is placeholders like image placeholders the gray boxes that you see as image are loading this is great for layout stability but again this is not content it does not count as the lcp its also a bit complicated because the biggest piece of content for you might be totally different for someone else so the most dramatic example of this is somebody on a very wide desktop screen and somebody on a very narrow mobile screen theyre going to get different types of lcp contents maybe on a large desktop screen wide images that are in landscape mode count as the biggest content but as you shrink that screen size smaller and smaller now its responsive and it takes up a relatively smaller proportion of the screen but at the same time maybe you have paragraphs of text or a heading now it starts to wrap onto more lines so now the area of that content is larger than the image making it the lcp candidate for that page also web applications are being built in ways that the standardization groups had never anticipated so on a traditional website each navigation requires a new html resource to render the next page and then each page view starts from scratch it resets the per performance timeline and then you get new lcp elements however single page applications or sas theyre all about reusing existing contents on the page updating only what has changed so as you navigate to a new page instead of discarding that old page and getting entirely new htm you keep the skeleton of the page around and dynamically swap in those new contents but the problem is that the performance timeline is going to keep ticking the lcp element already happened earlier in that session you do not get a new value so as a consequence of that theres only one lcp value for the entire session on that lcp site and the chrome team is aware of this uh its a pretty big blind spot in core web vitals especially considering how popular spas have become uh we are experimenting with a couple of origin trials to fix this uh but the important thing to remember for now is that spas are measured differently in core web vitals so if youve ever used the performance panel in chrome dev tools youve seen something like this if youre not familiar with it this is the trace view and were looking at the network track showing you the order and the timing of resource loading in whats known as a waterfall diagram and using this view you can more easily see how resources can actually depend on each other but im going to provide a simpler version of this just to go through a few examples for uh different lcp concepts in these diagrams each resource is colorcoded where you have blue for html purple for css green for images like the lcp image orange for javascript and red for fonts so using this diagram lets look at a hypothetical lcp and see why it might be slow the best way to do that is to break it up into phases and there are four phases for lcp they never overlap and between them they account for every single mill second of the lcp time each phase is also defined so that if one of them is the slowest that gives you a clue as to what the problem might be and also what the potential fixes for that could be and the first phase is time to first bite or ttfb some people might think of this as the backend time or the server think time ttfb also accounts for all of the time just to get to the server so this is all the networking stuff that happens along the way like redirects resolving dns negotiating tcp or ssl and you could if you needed also break the ttfb time down into these subphases to get a better look so that brings us to the number one most effective way to improve core web vitals and that is to aim for instant navigations because the absolute best way to improve ttfb and lcp as a whole is to be completely 100 independent from network requests so there are two ways to achieve instant navigations restorations and speculations you can think of them like optimizing based on where a user has already been and where theyre about to go a restoration takes a page that has already been loaded and already been rendered and it serves it back to the user upon request in its already rendered state from cache and a speculation takes a page that we think a user is about to navigate to and it prefetches and pre renders that in the background history restorations are made possible by the browsers back forward cache or bf cache you can think of it like taking a snapshot of the page as soon as the user navigates away storing it locally in memory for later and if the user eventually clicks back or forward to return to that page the browser can simply paint the same pixels back onto the screen exactly where the user left them so this is kind of a huge deal because one in five navigations on mobile are back forward and we know that mobile experiences are much worse than desktop so this is a great opportunity to flip some slow experiences to instant ones and the second trick to instant navigations is to speculatively prerender the next page that a user is about to visit and this is made possible with the speculation rules api its available now in chromium based browsers a speculation rule is an instruction to the browser that says which links to prerender and when you do need to be kind of strategic about this though because there are limitations to how many pre renders you can have at any given time so the best way that you can uh make sure that you pre render the most likely page or user is about to visit is to look at your analytics take that one link and uh eagerly prerender it on the page something else to watch out for that causes slow ttfb is redirects the problem with redirects is that each one of them is an extra unnecessary hop before arriving at the final content a user might be redirected from http to https or example to wwwexamplecom or if the content has moved they go from sl old to slne even external link shorteners like bitly and twitters tco they actually work by introducing redirects so they slow the page down the way to mitigate this is to ensure that the content the links point actually directly to that final url that the user is going to visit whenever possible its not always possible but the best way to find out if your site has a problem with redirects is to measure it and ill get back to measuring in a little bit later for now though our second most effective way to improve core web vitals is to use a cdn cdn are content delivery networks which means that they have a fleet of edge servers all around the world and by moving resources physically closer to your users requests can be handled much more quickly cdn also make it easier to enable other performance features at scale like caching compression and also the latest versions of the networking protocols like http and tls and one cdn in particular cloud flare actually just introduced a service last month called speed brain and that adds speculative prerendering to all sites on their free plan so by using a cdn you can attack performance from lots of different angles the second lcp phase is the time from ttfb to the start of the quest for the lcb resource which is called the resource load delay this phase only applies to image or videobased lcp elements um text based lcp elements arent associated with external resources so in those cases this phase is set to zero the third most effective way to improve core web vitals actually has two parts the first one is about discoverability remember from the case study with sunday citizen where the lcp source was hidden away in uh css 5 as a background image well that has a couple of really negative effects on performance so for one thing the browser has no idea that the image even exists until it loads and parses the stylesheet so theres no way for it to preload the image you could declaratively preload that image manually using something like a link tag but even if you do that youll run into the second problem which is that the stylesheet is still the bottleneck the browser has nowhere to put that image even if its already loaded until the css tells it to make it the background image for some element on the page also for what its worth client side rendering on the initial page load basically has the same issues except its javascript as the intermediary instead of css but the solution in both of these problems is exactly what shopify and sunday citizen did just moving it out of the css and into the html using a basic image tag it really is that simple another performance issue related to discoverability is lazy loading the loading equals lazy attribute is lcp poison do not use it it is bad it prevents the browser from eagerly loading the image as early as it could because it first needs to make sure that the image will appear within the viewport and thats not always a quick process maybe the only thing worse than loading equals lazy is the data source attribute because thats an indicator of a custom solution built in javascript and custom solutions are strictly slower than native ones and just to be clear lazy loading is good you should use it but only for content thats below the fold only for content thats not critical the lcp element is by definition critical so it should never be lazy loaded all right so i said this was a twoparter and part two is about prioritization even if the image is discoverable in the html it still might not load as early as it could if there are lots of other higher priority resources on the page chrome assigns images a default priority of low and for the first five images it bumps it up to medium but if you have critical render blocking static content like css javascript fonts those have high priority so you could actually be competing with those resources for network the fetch priority equals high attribute hints to the browser to raise the default priority up to high for these images so it can start loading much sooner all right now were on lcp phase number three resource load duration this one is also only applicable to lcp external resources like images and videos it measures how long the resource takes to load from start to finish and because lcp is measuring the time for an image to appear it wouldnt be unreasonable to think that the images download time is is usually the bottleneck and so when talking about lcp optimization its easy to jump straight into the things that make the image load more quickly and well get to those things in a second but i did want to take this opportunity to share some of the important data that my team has just published recently on the most common lcp bottlenecks in august my colleague brendan kenny published a blog post titled common misconceptions about how to optimize lcp the url is in the corner of the slide i also have a qr code at the end so i think this chart sums it up pretty well let me walk you through it uh for every website in the chrome user experience report we looked at their uh its not yet public we looked at their data on the four lcp phases we aggregated these phase distributions by taking their 75th percentile and then aggregated those stats over all 19 or so million websites in the data set by taking the median value of each of those so so it its a distribution of distributions its kind of mindbending i know uh we did that three times for websites having origin level lcp performance of good needs improvement and poor so you can look at this chart and see which phases sites tend to struggle with the most depending on their lcp performance and interestingly youll find that resource load duration which is represented by the green bar here is always the fastest phase it does gets slower as lcp gets worse but its still far from the bottleneck this data is not saying that you never need to worry about image optimization but maybe what we can take away from this is that images already tend to be optimized well enough that there are other higher priority things that you should be focusing on to improve your lcp the phases that actually seem to be most worrisome at least to me are ttfb in blue and resource load delay in red and thats why all three of the most effective ways to improve lcp so far have been attributed to those phases thats where websites have the most to gain all right so lets say youre one of the few sites that does have terrible resource load duration how do you fix it i think you all have heard these answers a hundred times before so well just breeze right through this so you should try using a modern image format like webp or avif to reduce that file size its going to speed up the download time as a result and and webp tends to be about 30 smaller than comparable jpeg or png images you can also reduce the file size by decreasing the image quality by a lot you dont need to save everything at 100 quality when the human eye cant even tell the difference between that and 80 you can also scale the images down to avoid wasting bites on pixels that never get rendered to the user so even if the image itself is small there are still some things that you can do to shorten the time it takes to go to the server and back the best way to do that is to set a long cache lifetime on your images assuming that they rarely change so then on repeat visits users users can just reuse what theyve already had in cach and that eliminates that network request entirely the other thing that you can do to avoid extra connection setup costs is hosting the image on the same domain as your html resource the same things that slow down ttfb can also slow down this image request you wont need to pay those costs if you use the connections that are already open now were at the fourth and final lcp phase which is element render delay when theres an lcp resource the render delay is measured from the time that the resource is done loading to the time that the resource is finally displayed to the user and when the element is text the render delay starts directly from the ttfb time so as a quick recap of what ive already already mentioned before attempts to minimize the load delay phase might end up shifting the problem to the render delay phase with preloading things like css background images client side rendering or lazy loading can continue to delay that lcp time in the form of render delay no matter how early youve preloaded that image so this is one of the few textbased lcp specific things to know and it has to do with web fonts fonts are external resources web fonts specifically so they show up in the waterfall diagram but theyre not considered to be an lcp resource so the render delay and uh loading duration phases do not actually apply the reason why web fonts matter to lcp has to do with the fact that lcp candidates change over time so lets say that your initial lcp is an h1 element and then your super cool custom web font loads a few seconds later if that web font changes the geometry of the text and bumps the size up just a little bit that is going to be the new lcp candidate several seconds later so it could hurt your performance the best fix for this is to ensure that the system font thats initially shown has a similar size to the custom web font and you can do that with the size adjust css property there are also ways to speed up your web font so that it doesnt impact the lcp time as much so fonts should be cached for a long time a lot of these things are the same things that you can do for images cach them for a long time use better compression use modern image format or font formats like waf 2 its an industry standard and its supported by all modern browsers you should also ideally self host your fonts eliminate that extra connection setup cost there are services like google fonts and they do offer some advanced uh font optimization strategies like subsetting you can say only load the glyphs in this font that are applicable to the characters that i display on this page like latin or whatever you could also subset a font to specific characters if your heading says hello world you can only load those letters h e l l so finally the silent killer of lcp performance is slow javascript execution and we dont usually think of this as a loading performance issue but it definitely could be and im not talking about client side rendering either anything that blocks the main thread for an extended period of time delays the next opportunity to paint and if the lcb image is downloaded and ready to go all of this time will be attributed to its render delay so the solution to this is to break up your long tasks but thats exactly what im about to talk about in the next few slides for inpp so lets get right into it this is core vital number two interaction to next paint inp performs really well on desktop 97 of sites have good inp 76 of sites have good inp on mobile which is a little deceivingly high because uh if you look at only the top 1000 most popular websites this number drops down to 63 now so there is definitely still a lot of room for improvement with inp despite the gains this is what a real interaction looks like in chrome dev tools the top is the interaction track and that shows that the user clicked on something probably uh creating pointer events and below that is all of the main thread activity during the interaction with each entry colorcoded and labeled according to the type of work that it did so again lets simplify this down the top part is the timing of the interaction using box and whiskers representing the three inp phases and the bottom part represents the main thread activity js execution in orange layout work in purple rendering and painting in green all right so using this diagram lets jump into the inp phases the left whisker represents the input delay phase this is what i uh first input delay used to measure thats measured from the moment that the user starts their interaction until the processing for that event can start the central box represents the processing duration this includes all of the time spent handling one or more of the events associated with the interaction like a pointer up and a click event of a tap interaction the right whisker represents the presentation delay this is everything that happens after the events have been processed until that frame is painted to the screen so the number four most effective way to improve core web vitals affects the input delay phase but it could also be just as impactful to the next phase as well and this is to avoid unnecessary javascript you can spend ages shaving milliseconds off of your runtime performance but it would be so much easier if you just throw that code away remember from the project feather story about the tipping point it came when chris was able to replace the flash player with the native html 5 video player and thankfully we dont have to worry about flash plugins anymore but we do have a ton of redundant javascript on our websites for things like libraries and polyfills and just for example css has gotten so incredibly powerful in recent years that things like animations could be done entirely scriptless you dont need to throw everything away either uh even if you just split your javascript bundles into things that you need to use now or use later then you can skip a lot of the time spent parsing and compiling unnecessary scripts number five is yielding to break up long tasks and this is listed under the processing phase but also it could be uh used to improve the input delay phase as well so so whenever javascript is taking a long time to do its work its an opportunity to pause give the browser a chance to paint a frame and then go back and resume your work and this is a strategy known as yielding you do need to be a little bit judicious about when you yield ideally you should do all of the user visible work first and then ensure those changes are displayed to the user and for any followup work thats needed like uh lower priority background tasks maybe logging to analytics that stuff that can happen later if doing lots of little bits of work many times you could over yield maybe if youre iterating over a large array you dont want to have your yield statement in that array because there is a little bit of a overhead to seed control and then take it back and that could add up instead what you want to do is kind of keep track of how long youve been in the loop yield only if its time to paint another frame so tasks should be kept to under 50 milliseconds and if youre a speed freak and you need to keep you know a 60 frame rate 60 fps frame rate then 16 milliseconds is going to be your budget so if youre looking to yield there are a couple of apis in the scheduler api called yield and posttask theyre available in chromium based browsers but for everybody else you can just use a simple set timeout and thatll usually do the trick during the presentation delay phase is the browser does all of the required style and layout work to get to the next frame ready to paint so number six is avoiding recurring or in avoid incurring large rendering updates however its possible to incur expensive rendering work during the processing phase when its forced by javascript code so youve probably heard this referred to as layout thrashing it happens when you modify a dom element in one part of your code and then you try measuring it in a new part of your code this forces the browser to recalculate all of the styles that are necessary to measure that element and that takes time layout thrashing specifically refers to doing this lots and lots of times over lots of elements causing a chain of expensive rendering work that blocks the main thread so you can break that chain by reorganizing your code so that your read operations happen before you modify the dom and then any necessary style recalculation work can happen normally during that presentation phase routine rendering updates do normally occur during the presentation phase and there are also some things that you can do to minimize that time the first is to reduce the number of affected nodes that need to be repainted for example changing the class list on the body could invalidate the styles for all of the child elements on the page and that could be made even more expensive if you have expensive css selectors that take the browser a long time to figure out if a specific node is going to be affected by that change so to mitigate this you could simplify the selectors but the most effective thing is just to be to minimize the number of dom elements on the page itself that leads to fewer elements to check and also faster style recalculation times another way to minimize rendering time is to lazily render contents that are off the screen using something called css containment the content visibility property just landed in firefox earlier this year so now it is available across all modern browsers you can configure it to tell browsers to skip an elements layout style and paint work if its not visible to the user and then when the element starts to come into view the browser can then resume its rendering work just in time all right the last metric is cumulative layout shift its the best performing core web vital on the wild in the wild and also arguably the most straightforward to optimize it is kind of a strange performance metric in that its not measured in terms of time it doesnt have any units at all and as a matter of fact we dont use it to uh we dont have any phases to break it down because its unitless so for that reason were just going to jump straight into the ways to optimize it with number seven reserving space for content by explicitly setting its dimensions so for an image element you should know how big its going to be and set its height and width accordingly otherwise if if uh the image has an initial height of zero pixels while the browser is waiting for it to load once that pops in thats going to shift the layout down causing a jarring user experience if you at least know what shape the content is going to be you can use the aspect ratio property in css and then you can dynamically size the content and in the worst case scenario if you have no idea whats about to happen you can at least reserve a little bit of space using the min height or minwidth attributes there might still be a noticeable shift but at least it wont be as severe this one might come as a surprise but number eight is uh actually to take advantage of the bf cache which weve already talked about as an lcp optimization the reason why this is a game changer for cls is because a significant amount of the layout shifts that happen actually occur during the initial page load so when you restore a page thats already been loaded and already been rendered any of those layout shifts will have already happened and so the new page view will appear much more stable but today the biggest blockers to bfc eligibility are uh listening to the unload event and also serving html resources with the cache control no store header so finally number nine is to optimize cls by avoiding layout inducing css properties in animations and transitions so for example if you want to slide a piece of content down you might be tempted to animate its down property but even if the content is on its own layer changing the property actually triggers layout work the other directional properties like up left and right behave exactly the same way and the solution to this is use css properties that are animated by the compositor thread instead that means using things like transform translate why to move things and these types of animations do not incur any layout shifts all right weve covered the core web vitals themselves so id like to use whatever remaining time i have to talk about the data that goes behind it i think most of you are familiar with the chrome user experience report or krux data set but i did want to highlight one really important distinction crux powers chrome and search tools like page speit insights dev tools search console its chromes source of truth for how fast or slow users are experiencing core web vitals its an incredibly powerful data set but the kinds of questions that its designed to answer are actually pretty simple like do 75 of the experiences meet the good threshold yes or no how about this metric or this form factor or this page its not designed to answer the second most important question which is okay so why was it slow for that you need diagnostic tools lighthouse is a diagnostic tool and it can point you in the right direction but it cant tell you why your userss experiences were slow it doesnt know how users access or behave on the page and it doesnt know what their lcp elements tend to be but these are all things that you can measure yourselves and the name for that is real user measurement or rum this is something that each site will need to instrument themselves using a commercial rum product uh assuming they have core web vital support or some kind of homegrown solution but the data is worth its weight in gold because you can use it to understand why things are slow and how to reproduce them data is also really hard to argue with um you might recommend to a client that they should uh consider cleaning up some of their marketing tags uh the push back usually sounds something like but we need those well then you can come back to them with data to say uh such and such a tag typically adds 250 milliseconds to every click on the page and its robbing you of a good inpp score well maybe they chang their mind the other thing thats great about rum data is that you can measure the impact of your changes ideally with something like an ab test but even just watching the change over time is really really great uh krux data moves very slowly its a 28 day aggregation but rum data on the other hand you can slice it any way you want uh and when you correlate that with other business business metrics in your analytics you can paint a really compelling picture about the impact that youre having and how valuable your work is just to give you idea of whats possible and this is using all free google tools this is a dashboard that i built to diagnose inp issues on our webdev website it uses the attribution build of the open source web vitals js library to measure the user experiences and get diagnostic data about it i send that off to google analytics using custom events i process all of that data on big query and i visualize it in looker studio so for example i can use this data to track inp performance across the entire site or groups of pages i plot it out over time or as a full distribution and i can drill down into the most popular and problematic areas in this case it looks like the learn pages are especially slow so i can explore the inp phases to see where the time is spent and what is causing it to be slow i know its hard to draw any kind of conclusion from this at a glance but uh this data did help me understand that there was something other than script processing time that was slowing down interactions the input and presentation delay phases were much slower so i dug deeper into what users were interacting with and when i found that the most common interactions were kind of confusing users were just clicking on text uh thats not very interactive but something was still causing that to be slow so the dashboard gave me all of the information i needed to build a reproducible test case so i could figure it out locally in dev tools so i loaded up the page i started to trace i clicked on the heading text and heres what i found and just like in the rum data there was a relatively quick processing duration with those long whiskers extending outward indicating a slow input delay and presentation delay phases there seemed to be a lot of expensive style recalculation work happening and dev tools helped me trace it back to animating spinners i hope this video loads yes so i thought that was really weird because i didnt see any spinners on the page but sure enough they were still there animating away in fact i found 31 spinner components on the page all stuck in an infinite loop and the problem was that despite being hidden hidden the animations were not paused pausing the animations was a simple enough fix so we pushed it live and we immediately saw a 25 improvement to our mobile imp across the learn pages so we still have more work to do getting our inp closer to the green but we are making progress and it wouldnt be possible without rum data to to guide the way so while its true that all of you in the seo community are focused on succeeding in search were still very closely aligned with our goals with the web performance community to improve core web vitals i hope i was able to show you that web performance i hope was able to show you web performance in a slightly different light uh and also how your work to improve core web vitals improves the speed of the web as a whole i also hope that you take these things that youve learned about core web vital metrics and the most effective ways to diagnose and optimize them and you do what you do best share it with the community and apply it in practice to help make an even faster web thank applause you g i more time applause",

        "raw_text": "thank you Mike hello everybody can you hear me we are good hello thank you Mike uh thank you everybody Welcome second day of this wonderful conference so I will tell you about uh Microsoft Bing and really what you have to think about the new area SEO for the AI area let's get started uh we'll cover AI we cover bigma master tool we'll tell you a lot about an next no in this technical SEO conference and some goodies for me more from beinging um my mission had been is really to create the world best index uh to satisfy all user so I download your site each and every day and if a content is missing from being sear results my that's my fault bad for me please do not contact me uh and really this is all about uh discovering the best content on the internet selecting it downloading it processing it and maybe saving it and annexing it so um but it's far more than that mean that it's not only the Blue Links it's also everything about AI everything about calot or uh AI experience this is also about the uh image search video search this is also about advertising where we validate content this is about news uh this is about everything you gave me everything we download is processed by my team um and we can go to news we can go to advertising yes when you do an ad advertising at beinging and Microsoft advertising it's verified by my team in term of quality but being is way bigger than people think it's we are also powering DDO we are powering yaho H skoa but we are also providing search and some AI things to meta open Ai and swisco and many many others cannot list them whole so when you see being in your log that's great but when you think about it there is far more uh engine that you may not be counting as being so being is way bigger than you think even bigger there says in Windows billions of user we are all over Windows obviously and here you can find Bing results if you just search from the start bar you can find Bing everywhere and this unfortunately won't be counted as a traffic to your sites because there is no referer windows but it's still being powering this experience so we are somehow in lot of places surfacing not only at Bing but also elsewhere think about that when you think SEO next is the past of AI Innovation is really exponential that's crazy I cannot catch up with everything that is happening at in AI a lot is happening each and every day and even more each and every hour now this is really really speeding up not only what's happened in the past uh but even more these days all this innovation in AI trigger that okay rele search engine come up with AI augmented solution such as in 2023 being augmented with this shat no name calot to really offer customer the ability to go deeper to search better to find content that they maybe were not able to find until this day over search engine as Google follow and now we have ai that is surfacing everywhere not only as generated AI as caption as shat all of uh experiences search experiences you can find this uh content surfacing and this experiences surfacing so truly amazing keep we keep innovating we keep iterating on this experiences so in 2023 this is really the the time when we we enable really some some crazy Innovative experiences to the user you are all part of Techo you are all Savvy Tech you know what we are talking about but think about it millions of user that were really so far experiencing only 10 Blue Links okay they got a shot experience what's that they got really experiences that were uh really new and Innovative for them so this is where search engine not only are displaying things but they are also uh learning from user and as we learn from user we are optimizing this experiences to obviously satisfy the user and so TW we saw this kind of learning curve and really people were saying okay what is that I'm lost maybe I will click back I will go back to sech results and as we discover that it was very useful this kind of set experience we saw even more traffic coming to the shat as we we improving also the quality the layout the display This was um they were maximizing um results on this experiences and so 2024 is we saw that people were sticking to it we're really loving it and continue to use that so there is really two two kind of searches and two kind of EX what people are doing in Search and let's say copot and AI shat experiences so think about it this is if you search for YouTube you go to youtube.com you really need to you really don't need to have an experience that is uh chat experience augmented AI augmented this is what we call navigational queries you query for something you get what you want you click the link you are gone you are happy you are satisfied by this query it's kind of what SE is doing this is we try to Max minimize the number of uh the time from the query to the click to the good quality site if we can satisfy the query in one click perfect we are really happy uh about this kind of experience then there is uh kind of copal lot where often the user does not really know what he or she is looking for and will kind of potentially iterate and this is where we can really engage a discussion conversation with a user to be able to find the best content and also to to Really Le this kind of complex query that search may not be able to answer so you can do such crazy very very long query in calot and we will provide content that is satisfying this query leveraging the best of AI Tech we have to release yourface content and links to your sites enabling you uh to get traffic from suchar experience so search I know exactly what I want want and copal lot story AI story where I S I know what I want and maybe I will iterate or the engine the AI engine will be smart enough to really provide on the first results this ideal content so next is really Su is not dead this say we keep telling that for years it's really evolving and it's evolving in a direction that is some very interesting this is where there is a diversification there is more uh solution out there to provide fundamentally traffic qualified traffic to your sites so this is not only uh search as usual this is AI this is various solution being copal lot thiss is perplexity thiss is open AI this is all this AI solution thiss is maybe Tik Tok and others that are providing traffic to your sites so something to really consider there is more player more players that are driving additional traffic to your site sometime it's they are draining a little bit from search engine if not a more lot more they says also that there is overall driving more traffic overall to sides so something to consider optimizing for one player is maybe not what you should focus on moving forward um we are on the east coast and I want to say I want to allight someone on the east coast in Philadelphia we're speaking about Phil yesterday and um will has some good insights about what's happening in the industry this day there is over players that are also detecting that mean they detect that there is clicks from search and there is clicks from AI solution and what he really care about is really about getting not clicks getting conversion getting dollar value from search and from Ai and what he observed he really went deep I was speaking to him two days ago and he really went deep in data and showing me that AI is generating absolutely Stellar clicks absolutely mean when I say Stellar this is things that are converting to registration to an event to registration to a newsletter to people buying things click is often exploration is a click okay link number one click link number two go back iterate often what people as we are observing is that and this is one of them I've got many example where people are observing more quality clicks from AI solution so I did this graph it's not the best graph but fundamentally look at 2D motion look at clicks of I see suu and it's very thing to do this says okay you go to your meetings to say hey look the clicks is moving up it's good personally I I think you should not care so much about clicks you should look really at conversion rate about the dollar value that really there clicks are adding and so you can see really there's two Dimension one is about oh you may have a lot of clicks on search but maybe you may not have enough conversion you may not have people that are buying something on your shopping s and so on so really look at two this two Dimension because if you go to the CMO CEO to tell I've got lot of clicks and you go back next day to say no no I've got a dollar coming from this clicks this is better for your career to save the second one than the first one so think about that ideally try to plot that come back to the industry telling a that's fact we may have less clicks from AI but we have far better clicks from a I than from search we obviously still want to have great search results it's not about diminishing the value of search but there is also a real value of AI so next is I want to briefly introduce you being generated search and tell you more about it because what we saw is that there is search and AI but maybe maybe there is a way to do the best of both world uh to again trigger uh very good links and clicks to your s sites so if you search ad beinging today for what is a spaghetti western movie think you will see a very long and complex experience very long search result page with lot of information in it such as movies about this Western PTI J J and many more so the experience is really about fundamentally this is we know that there is not one good results for this query there is a set of things that people are looking at when they search for that so we can really explore and provide information directly on the search result page with a long list of categories and answers that may satisfy the user it's kind of a magazine thing it's kind of a lot of information provided to the user but we perceived from the data analytic we have that it's really the best results we can provide to the user understanding we understand the user the history what user are Weare doing and providing the best user friendly experience to the user it's kind of thinking already what the user will click next and based on what they have done in the past providing again this best experience to the user it's kind of mixing AI where the layout and the placement of all this answer is really uh based on uh what we believe should be it's never the same you will see different experiences for the generated search um this is using the llm using a lot of tech to again provide the best answer uh to the user you can try generated search by just querying for being generated search and you will see a carousel with lot of links to try it out so encouraging you to play with it this is kind of a future of search this is where AI is really coming in the search results to really kind of potentially change the 10 Blue Links to provide a generated AI experience that is not only the placement of information is completely based on AI the links themselves may be caption generated AI generated lot of AI in play for such Pages um and you can test that also you can also observe that sometime we you may display the Deep search button so the Deep search is something that is absolutely some more fascinating this SV this is this is not fast this is not one millisec to get the results why because we will do deep search we will go deep in the stock we will run llm models we will do a lot of things to often generate this kind of experience on the fly to really try to satisfy this this query this to surface uh really quality content it it crazy expensive in term of CPU AI logic to really go deep in the stock to to really retrieve uh this content and try to satisfy the query so I let you play with this we think it's the some also the future of search and obviously as we are optimizing Tech this is to bring this technology in the search page in the default page as needed to again satisfy this query where the default may be not satisfactory or we believe we should uh iterate more to display relevant results next is I want to tell you about uh being we master tool a little bit about what we release uh what we are releasing this week so being we master tool is fundamentally a tool to free tool to help you to get more user to your sites to to tell you what's wrong on your sites or give you abilities to to understand what we want you to do to

Monday to Cyber Monday last year so uh pay attention to this uh want to share that we are surfacing clicks and impression not only from search but also from search n AI solution as copilot within this uh search performance report so yes we listened to uh feedback people were complaining and so we have exended if you are not happy please contact us and we will consider your feedback next as we are in Tech Cas I will spend a little bit time on andex no why andex no why this is so critical for um not only for being but of over search engine so what's happening with search engine is that we are dumb I will be clear in calling you see Google speaking about calling and optimizing HTTP download and whatever the fact is that we really don't know what's happening on website at scale we may know what's happening on some head URL homepages and think like this if you have a sites with billions of URL of Amazon sorry I simply don't know if as a certain gen if a t product a really small product has been updated price has been updated so what we do is we send simply send the Coler to see if we are lucky if something has changed or not or if there is a new URL a new outlink helping us to discover the content that's dumb they says then you are surfacing problems as C quter okay what's stupid so the view the view what we want to do is really move to a model where uh search engine will be augmented via an API to tell us what change and so this is as easy as you submit an URL and I trust you I come with a color and thank you I download the content Bingo the latest content is reflected in the search engine no more quala no more craziness I can allocate lot of processing capacity JavaScript processings and so on on to this URL that has just been downloaded because you are telling me that the content has changed great thank you I can benefit from that here is a two-minute video to tell you more about an next in the ever evolving digital landscape leaning Brands like Yahoo eBay USA Today Cloud flare and more have recognized the importance of embracing index now to enhance their online presence this is more than a trend it's a GameChanger without index Now search engines crawl websites at their own pace not when site owners publish new content these unpredictable crawlers can miss newly published content for hours or even days this means Searchers are unable to benefit from your latest product listings press releases or other important content and without the ability to control when and what content is indexed search results captions can appear outdated and lower your site's rankings by sending customers to wrong or broken links this leads to mismatched cont content and frustrated Searchers who miss out on your website's latest offerings but with just one simple ping index now shares your website's new updated and deleted content across all participating search engines as soon as they happen give me Searchers access to your most relevant and current information at the time of search and by updating your content to match evolving user needs you not only contribute to enhanced user satisfaction but also higher click-through rates longer on-site engagement improved s Authority and ultimately higher search engine rankings index now guides crawlers when and what to crawl significantly decreasing advertising cost by improving your organic rankings while also reducing crawl cost having better online visibility isn't just about having a website it's about your latest content being found as a free protocol index now seamlessly integrates into most content Management Systems in fact many content management systems and Cloud delivery networks already support index Now by default requiring little to no effort on your part to learn how you can adopt index now simply visit bing.com index now so I will tell you more so you as display on the video you can go to bing.com endex no and um get um links information about how to convince your boss uh to adopt an next no and implementation can be first your sites may be an no enable already if you are using a good content management system more are coming or you have plugins for uh the top content measurement system so it can take you five minutes to adopt if you are your own stock with the index no protocol is easy uh we see having a set of interns last summer that did implementation for a lot of top sites so we were very happy to see that but uh we offer you insights within big master tool to help you to tell you if you do a good job at uh publishing content in term of added updated and deleted URL I want to speak a little bit about the slides um I do believe that theu Community is not paying attention enough to deleted urls and updated URLs so this is for anex or if you plan adopting anex no in the future please also pay attention today about what's happening so the community is all about yeah I've got my content IND next y win no it's not a win it's just the start of a journey it's also the fact that you need to think that things are changing all the time on the Internet you may have Oncor text coming to your URLs you may have lot of information on the web linking to your content but certainly need to be aware that hey there is additional things that is happening for this URL please we need to reprocess this URL we need maybe to get it reindexed second is that yourl may be gone from your site because you remove a product let's imagine that the customer click the link going to this page it's really bad from a search engine standpoint why because the customer obviously won't long won't stay there it will click back short DW time we call that DW time of getting to the content is bad for search engine this is a bad signal we think your site is not relevant so the fact that the content is deleted if we don't drain this content from search engine is bad so it's not only about adding the content once it's also about deleting removing the bad content next update think about this beautiful video you just publish on YouTube about your products great obviously if you get it Index right away and you should this URL will have maybe one view cont because you've tested that this URL R fine and yeah one view cont we don't want to link to video having one view cont we prefer to link to video having 1 million view cont so as you get traffic if you don't reflect in search engine that this video has many view cont then search engine will continue to think that this video has one view count bad so it's not only about I want to share another example price okay you went live with a $255 thing but now you have a promotion at $99 if certain gen are not aware that this is $99 they may prefer the oversight that as the price as $99 because yeah we want to SA is by your customer and we prefer linking to customer to something having $99 but something having $255 and I can go forever so having the latest content index in search engine from this technical suo audience truly matter and then the question become okay when I've got to send the Fe the notification to the search engine think this is an Amazon page wow lot of information on the page price reviews comments if sent us notification for each and every change on Amazon we will be bombarded with billions of URL every day because yes people are viewing sending comments reviewing things so you need to think about a strategy SEO strategy to know when to notify the search engine clearly I did URL right away deleted URL right away and then the tricky question is really about when do you want to notify for the update and so I did a blog post to provide some view it's really think about that as generic then you need to adopt that for your sites to know when to notify search engine being Andover the benefit of anx no is that with anx no you will notify all search engine having adopting an xn I do believe this is something that is very important from a ranking to satisfy customer in search engine and so pay attention to this and next no is really getting uh adoption um we are very pleased at Microsoft to see that and over search engine are observing the same we do believe that there is a path toward uh nearly all search engine including the very big one adopting an xn so we receive already 3.5 billion URL uh 18% of results click new URL click being are next why because if you have a News website if we there is an earthquake you better have to be first in the sear Eng if you are behind you don't get the benefit of clicks you don't get the benefit of being linked because people don't know you they says you are you are P two you are P three so being first toly especially for news websites um so we are very pleased to announce uh that archive.org uh adopt andex no as a search engine andex no is for big players but also archive.org that is a very big player in scale uh and so we get this code from Mark um is pleased to get the benefit of anexo to help them uh getting the latest content on the internet we are pleased to collaborate with them to provide information to them about what change on the internet in term of added updated and deleted content to help them doing a better job at archiving the internet so so far there is um being your next snam never as I've got my t-shirt thank you Patrick to ad to adopt an x no but there is uh one more we will see two to three more over the following quarter but adopt an next no and um we cross figure and we cannot say more but in 2024 2025 it should be uh yeah some very big one that will be hopefully adopting because clearly we are a fresher uh than many search many other large search engine on lot of content already so this is open to all uh search engine and xno and so we encourage you to really adopt to benefit in all this search engine and all the search search engine power by beinging today and so please pay attention uh Max are you in the room okay kast is adopting an next no thank you Max thank you kast more coming I just want to highlight conas because Max and conas is in the room should be but there is a lot of the industry that is adopting an X now today so again if you are news pay attention because they will win versus you so please adopt an x no to more announcement we want really the backbone of the internet as good no adopting an XO so this says um if the CMS as good thank you good for adopting next adop an next then you um this is builtin and thank you we you support that last more foring much more foring so uh did you pay attention to this page I want to share something good this is this is my points at being my B reward points at being and just by this is I've got 7K 700k being reward point and just by doing this uh you win money

content generation is ship you can iterate fast change your sites if you take control of color you can you can do ABY testing think about that people are telling me I did AB testing and this is the result I don't see benefit hey yeah sure we didn't even call your content or do you want that we do a testing if you don't take control of caller to do this AB testing thing focus on satisfying your customer I spoke about conversion versus clicks p con to this and benefit from AI but with a human human brain AI itself beware and follow search engine guidelines very important again take control of your game with real timeing and last this is about this update delete thing I a website is not just about getting the content index is about really reflecting the each and every latest content change in the search engine pay attention to this so use B web master tool use Microsoft Clarity verus free offering for web for web Masters you will get a far better uh understanding of your sites um I

a presentation [Applause]",
        "cleaned_text": "thank you mike hello everybody can you hear me we are good hello thank you mike uh thank you everybody welcome second day of this wonderful conference so i will tell you about uh microsoft bing and really what you have to think about the new area seo for the ai area lets get started uh well cover ai we cover bigma master tool well tell you a lot about an next no in this technical seo conference and some goodies for me more from beinging um my mission had been is really to create the world best index uh to satisfy all user so i download your site each and every day and if a content is missing from being sear results my thats my fault bad for me please do not contact me uh and really this is all about uh discovering the best content on the internet selecting it downloading it processing it and maybe saving it and annexing it so um but its far more than that mean that its not only the blue links its also everything about ai everything about calot or uh ai experience this is also about the uh image search video search this is also about advertising where we validate content this is about news uh this is about everything you gave me everything we download is processed by my team um and we can go to news we can go to advertising yes when you do an ad advertising at beinging and microsoft advertising its verified by my team in term of quality but being is way bigger than people think its we are also powering ddo we are powering yaho h skoa but we are also providing search and some ai things to meta open ai and swisco and many many others cannot list them whole so when you see being in your log thats great but when you think about it there is far more uh engine that you may not be counting as being so being is way bigger than you think even bigger there says in windows billions of user we are all over windows obviously and here you can find bing results if you just search from the start bar you can find bing everywhere and this unfortunately wont be counted as a traffic to your sites because there is no referer windows but its still being powering this experience so we are somehow in lot of places surfacing not only at bing but also elsewhere think about that when you think seo next is the past of ai innovation is really exponential thats crazy i cannot catch up with everything that is happening at in ai a lot is happening each and every day and even more each and every hour now this is really really speeding up not only whats happened in the past uh but even more these days all this innovation in ai trigger that okay rele search engine come up with ai augmented solution such as in 2023 being augmented with this shat no name calot to really offer customer the ability to go deeper to search better to find content that they maybe were not able to find until this day over search engine as google follow and now we have ai that is surfacing everywhere not only as generated ai as caption as shat all of uh experiences search experiences you can find this uh content surfacing and this experiences surfacing so truly amazing keep we keep innovating we keep iterating on this experiences so in 2023 this is really the the time when we we enable really some some crazy innovative experiences to the user you are all part of techo you are all savvy tech you know what we are talking about but think about it millions of user that were really so far experiencing only 10 blue links okay they got a shot experience whats that they got really experiences that were uh really new and innovative for them so this is where search engine not only are displaying things but they are also uh learning from user and as we learn from user we are optimizing this experiences to obviously satisfy the user and so tw we saw this kind of learning curve and really people were saying okay what is that im lost maybe i will click back i will go back to sech results and as we discover that it was very useful this kind of set experience we saw even more traffic coming to the shat as we we improving also the quality the layout the display this was um they were maximizing um results on this experiences and so 2024 is we saw that people were sticking to it were really loving it and continue to use that so there is really two two kind of searches and two kind of ex what people are doing in search and lets say copot and ai shat experiences so think about it this is if you search for youtube you go to youtubecom you really need to you really dont need to have an experience that is uh chat experience augmented ai augmented this is what we call navigational queries you query for something you get what you want you click the link you are gone you are happy you are satisfied by this query its kind of what se is doing this is we try to max minimize the number of uh the time from the query to the click to the good quality site if we can satisfy the query in one click perfect we are really happy uh about this kind of experience then there is uh kind of copal lot where often the user does not really know what he or she is looking for and will kind of potentially iterate and this is where we can really engage a discussion conversation with a user to be able to find the best content and also to to really le this kind of complex query that search may not be able to answer so you can do such crazy very very long query in calot and we will provide content that is satisfying this query leveraging the best of ai tech we have to release yourface content and links to your sites enabling you uh to get traffic from suchar experience so search i know exactly what i want want and copal lot story ai story where i s i know what i want and maybe i will iterate or the engine the ai engine will be smart enough to really provide on the first results this ideal content so next is really su is not dead this say we keep telling that for years its really evolving and its evolving in a direction that is some very interesting this is where there is a diversification there is more uh solution out there to provide fundamentally traffic qualified traffic to your sites so this is not only uh search as usual this is ai this is various solution being copal lot thiss is perplexity thiss is open ai this is all this ai solution thiss is maybe tik tok and others that are providing traffic to your sites so something to really consider there is more player more players that are driving additional traffic to your site sometime its they are draining a little bit from search engine if not a more lot more they says also that there is overall driving more traffic overall to sides so something to consider optimizing for one player is maybe not what you should focus on moving forward um we are on the east coast and i want to say i want to allight someone on the east coast in philadelphia were speaking about phil yesterday and um will has some good insights about whats happening in the industry this day there is over players that are also detecting that mean they detect that there is clicks from search and there is clicks from ai solution and what he really care about is really about getting not clicks getting conversion getting dollar value from search and from ai and what he observed he really went deep i was speaking to him two days ago and he really went deep in data and showing me that ai is generating absolutely stellar clicks absolutely mean when i say stellar this is things that are converting to registration to an event to registration to a newsletter to people buying things click is often exploration is a click okay link number one click link number two go back iterate often what people as we are observing is that and this is one of them ive got many example where people are observing more quality clicks from ai solution so i did this graph its not the best graph but fundamentally look at 2d motion look at clicks of i see suu and its very thing to do this says okay you go to your meetings to say hey look the clicks is moving up its good personally i i think you should not care so much about clicks you should look really at conversion rate about the dollar value that really there clicks are adding and so you can see really theres two dimension one is about oh you may have a lot of clicks on search but maybe you may not have enough conversion you may not have people that are buying something on your shopping s and so on so really look at two this two dimension because if you go to the cmo ceo to tell ive got lot of clicks and you go back next day to say no no ive got a dollar coming from this clicks this is better for your career to save the second one than the first one so think about that ideally try to plot that come back to the industry telling a thats fact we may have less clicks from ai but we have far better clicks from a i than from search we obviously still want to have great search results its not about diminishing the value of search but there is also a real value of ai so next is i want to briefly introduce you being generated search and tell you more about it because what we saw is that there is search and ai but maybe maybe there is a way to do the best of both world uh to again trigger uh very good links and clicks to your s sites so if you search ad beinging today for what is a spaghetti western movie think you will see a very long and complex experience very long search result page with lot of information in it such as movies about this western pti j j and many more so the experience is really about fundamentally this is we know that there is not one good results for this query there is a set of things that people are looking at when they search for that so we can really explore and provide information directly on the search result page with a long list of categories and answers that may satisfy the user its kind of a magazine thing its kind of a lot of information provided to the user but we perceived from the data analytic we have that its really the best results we can provide to the user understanding we understand the user the history what user are weare doing and providing the best user friendly experience to the user its kind of thinking already what the user will click next and based on what they have done in the past providing again this best experience to the user its kind of mixing ai where the layout and the placement of all this answer is really uh based on uh what we believe should be its never the same you will see different experiences for the generated search um this is using the llm using a lot of tech to again provide the best answer uh to the user you can try generated search by just querying for being generated search and you will see a carousel with lot of links to try it out so encouraging you to play with it this is kind of a future of search this is where ai is really coming in the search results to really kind of potentially change the 10 blue links to provide a generated ai experience that is not only the placement of information is completely based on ai the links themselves may be caption generated ai generated lot of ai in play for such pages um and you can test that also you can also observe that sometime we you may display the deep search button so the deep search is something that is absolutely some more fascinating this sv this is this is not fast this is not one millisec to get the results why because we will do deep search we will go deep in the stock we will run llm models we will do a lot of things to often generate this kind of experience on the fly to really try to satisfy this this query this to surface uh really quality content it it crazy expensive in term of cpu ai logic to really go deep in the stock to to really retrieve uh this content and try to satisfy the query so i let you play with this we think its the some also the future of search and obviously as we are optimizing tech this is to bring this technology in the search page in the default page as needed to again satisfy this query where the default may be not satisfactory or we believe we should uh iterate more to display relevant results next is i want to tell you about uh being we master tool a little bit about what we release uh what we are releasing this week so being we master tool is fundamentally a tool to free tool to

because its really helping you to to see this kind of yearoveryear traffic you can compare um you can compare um cyber monday to cyber monday last year so uh pay attention to this uh want to share that we are surfacing clicks and impression not only from search but also from search n ai solution as copilot within this uh search performance report so yes we listened to uh feedback people were complaining and so we have exended if you are not happy please contact us and we will consider your feedback next as we are in tech cas i will spend a little bit time on andex no why andex no why this is so critical for um not only for being but of over search engine so whats happening with search engine is that we are dumb i will be clear in calling you see google speaking about calling and optimizing http download and whatever the fact is that we really dont know whats happening on website at scale we may know whats happening on some head url homepages and think like this if you have a sites with billions of url of amazon sorry i simply dont know if as a certain gen if a t product a really small product has been updated price has been updated so what we do is we send simply send the coler to see if we are lucky if something has changed or not or if there is a new url a new outlink helping us to discover the content thats dumb they says then you are surfacing problems as c quter okay whats stupid so the view the view what we want to do is really move to a model where uh search engine will be augmented via an api to tell us what change and so this is as easy as you submit an url and i trust you i come with a color and thank you i download the content bingo the latest content is reflected in the search engine no more quala no more craziness i can allocate lot of processing capacity javascript processings and so on on to this url that has just been downloaded because you are telling me that the content has changed great thank you i can benefit from that here is a twominute video to tell you more about an next in the ever evolving digital landscape leaning brands like yahoo ebay usa today cloud flare and more have recognized the importance of embracing index now to enhance their online presence this is more than a trend its a gamechanger without index now search engines crawl websites at their own pace not when site owners publish new content these unpredictable crawlers can miss newly published content for hours or even days this means searchers are unable to benefit from your latest product listings press releases or other important content and without the ability to control when and what content is indexed search results captions can appear outdated and lower your sites rankings by sending customers to wrong or broken links this leads to mismatched cont content and frustrated searchers who miss out on your websites latest offerings but with just one simple ping index now shares your websites new updated and deleted content across all participating search engines as soon as they happen give me searchers access to your most relevant and current information at the time of search and by updating your content to match evolving user needs you not only contribute to enhanced user satisfaction but also higher clickthrough rates longer onsite engagement improved s authority and ultimately higher search engine rankings index now guides crawlers when and what to crawl significantly decreasing advertising cost by improving your organic rankings while also reducing crawl cost having better online visibility isnt just about having a website its about your latest content being found as a free protocol index now seamlessly integrates into most content management systems in fact many content management systems and cloud delivery networks already support index now by default requiring little to no effort on your part to learn how you can adopt index now simply visit bingcom index now so i will tell you more so you as display on the video you can go to bingcom endex no and um get um links information about how to convince your boss uh to adopt an next no and implementation can be first your sites may be an no enable already if you are using a good content management system more are coming or you have plugins for uh the top content measurement system so it can take you five minutes to adopt if you are your own stock with the index no protocol is easy uh we see having a set of interns last summer that did implementation for a lot of top sites so we were very happy to see that but uh we offer you insights within big master tool to help you to tell you if you do a good job at uh publishing content in term of added updated and deleted url i want to speak a little bit about the slides um i do believe that theu community is not paying attention enough to deleted urls and updated urls so this is for anex or if you plan adopting anex no in the future please also pay attention today about whats happening so the community is all about yeah ive got my content ind next y win no its not a win its just the start of a journey its also the fact that you need to think that things are changing all the time on the internet you may have oncor text coming to your urls you may have lot of information on the web linking to your content but certainly need to be aware that hey there is additional things that is happening for this url please we need to reprocess this url we need maybe to get it reindexed second is that yourl may be gone from your site because you remove a product lets imagine that the customer click the link going to this page its really bad from a search engine standpoint why because the customer obviously wont long wont stay there it will click back short dw time we call that dw time of getting to the content is bad for search engine this is a bad signal we think your site is not relevant so the fact that the content is deleted if we dont drain this content from search engine is bad so its not only about adding the content once its also about deleting removing the bad content next update think about this beautiful video you just publish on youtube about your products great obviously if you get it index right away and you should this url will have maybe one view cont because youve tested that this url r fine and yeah one view cont we dont want to link to video having one view cont we prefer to link to video having 1 million view cont so as you get traffic if you dont reflect in search engine that this video has many view cont then search engine will continue to think that this video has one view count bad so its not only about i want to share another example price okay you went live with a 255 thing but now you have a promotion at 99 if certain gen are not aware that this is 99 they may prefer the oversight that as the price as 99 because yeah we want to sa is by your customer and we prefer linking to customer to something having 99 but something having 255 and i can go forever so having the latest content index in search engine from this technical suo audience truly matter and then the question become okay when ive got to send the fe the notification to the search engine think this is an amazon page wow lot of information on the page price reviews comments if sent us notification for each and every change on amazon we will be bombarded with billions of url every day because yes people are viewing sending comments reviewing things so you need to think about a strategy seo strategy to know when to notify the search engine clearly i did url right away deleted url right away and then the tricky question is really about when do you want to notify for the update and so i did a blog post to provide some view its really think about that as generic then you need to adopt that for your sites to know when to notify search engine being andover the benefit of anx no is that with anx no you will notify all search engine having adopting an xn i do believe this is something that is very important from a ranking to satisfy customer in search engine and so pay attention to this and next no is really getting uh adoption um we are very pleased at microsoft to see that and over search engine are observing the same we do believe that there is a path toward uh nearly all search engine including the very big one adopting an xn so we receive already 35 billion url uh 18 of results click new url click being are next why because if you have a news website if we there is an earthquake you better have to be first in the sear eng if you are behind you dont get the benefit of clicks you dont get the benefit of being linked because people dont know you they says you are you are p two you are p three so being first toly especially for news websites um so we are very pleased to announce uh that archiveorg uh adopt andex no as a search engine andex no is for big players but also archiveorg that is a very big player in scale uh and so we get this code from mark um is pleased to get the benefit of anexo to help them uh getting the latest content on the internet we are pleased to collaborate with them to provide information to them about what change on the internet in term of added updated and deleted content to help them doing a better job at archiving the internet so so far there is um being your next snam never as ive got my tshirt thank you patrick to ad to adopt an x no but there is uh one more we will see two to three more over the following quarter but adopt an next no and um we cross figure and we cannot say more but in 2024 2025 it should be uh yeah some very big one that will be hopefully adopting because clearly we are a fresher uh than many search many other large search engine on lot of content already so this is open to all uh search engine and xno and so we encourage you to really adopt to benefit in all this search engine and all the search search engine power by beinging today and so please pay attention uh max are you in the room okay kast is adopting an next no thank you max thank you kast more coming i just want to highlight conas because max and conas is in the room should be but there is a lot of the industry that is adopting an x now today so again if you are news pay attention because they will win versus you so please adopt an x no to more announcement we want really the backbone of the internet as good no adopting an xo so this says um if the cms as good thank you good for adopting next adop an next then you um this is builtin and thank you we you support that last more foring much more foring so uh did you pay attention to this page i want to share something good this is this is my points at being my b reward points at being and just by this is ive got 7k 700k

of us left uh just kidding this this s it's sad you know when I want to come up with jokes and nobody laughes so no worries hopefully the last one hopefully the last one but yes I'm so very excited to be here um first time in uh rally um very very surprised and I love it I have mentioned to a couple of people that it's like the typical uh city that you see in U in us movies uh so it's like yeah this not New York or LA right this like typical H so very nice and very looking forward to share with you today and uh today I come to talk something that I believe that all of us can feel identified right like the challenges that we unfortunately L are going through in in SEO something that uh we literally need to fight with and struggle with and coincidentally I ran into an SEO friend who I started with in the SEO work back in 2007 and I feel very old now uh and uh literally since that time when I started doing SEO I don't think that I have never felt that the pace of changes was like this right all the uncertainty too around it like oh we have ai overviews because all of the sudden Google has realized that they need to keep up with llms and of course they need to integrate it in their current interface to keep making money with ads somehow and then sir GPT the Prototype is out there and just a few days ago they mentioned that they will start to integrate it it after testing it and then all of a sudden maybe that doesn't matter because gen Z and younger people are searching in Tik Tok and um unfortunately it doesn't seem that the reliability of the compan is an issue there but yes there's that so it has never been harder to sell a CO I as around to seo seo F subscribers a few months back on a survey that I did about SEO Consulting is has also never been harder to achieve SEO goals uh because of all of this uncertainty among the common issues that we know that we face on SEO day today but llms also has opened the doors to so much awesomeness right the Automation in our SEO work no I am not referring to this one sorry this was supposed to be a joke too um the content automation AI content junk was not necessarily like the purpose of uh the benefits of automation that we could all look for uh but I was um referring to the ones that I'm going to explain in a bit sadly this is what at the end of the day has make it harder and harder from a technical SEO standpoint for Google to start indexing more content especially new content right but on the other hand we have this awesomeness right um so many new people have started to automate stuff uh I see every week literally because I go and take a look at the latest tools the latest scripts Etc to include them in the tool section of SEO new scripts new tools new validators from people who were not coding like a year and a half ago and they started to do it thanks to chat GPT sh uh thanks to all of the Integrations that crawlers like for example screaming frog has and they can connect to apis and literally with CLA artifacts and chat GPT canvas there are no excuses right I have been playing around quite a few some forecasting some validations here um integrating with open AI um also apis making it easier to validate and assess a few of the things that were challeng more challenging before so we also have access to SEO solutions that solve some of the some top challenges in technical seos uh realistically right so at the end of the day we should be okay too even better not because of all of these waves of llms but tools that we used to have before have taken a new level so for example we have tools for implementing internal linking a scale structured data scale um even to develop knowledge raft directly from to our website just a few clicks away in links they do a great job at that we have CDN now that allow us to change HTTP headers uh to implement a lot of not only configurations to improve speed but a execute reil rides to implement a lot of stuff developing SEO AB testing at scale much more easily to real time SEO alerting tools to monitor any updates of key technical SEO configurations cloud-based crawlers with detail reports also featuring The Raw versus render gap of JavaScript client Side based JavaScript at scale um SEO platforms that allow us to check out changes not only for your own pages but also any side page hello amazing new feature or relatively new feature from ASF by the way uh so yeah all of a sudden I feel like well but this should be fine isn't it we have all of these new features so much awesomeness that we didn't used to have uh back in the day so I was like but is this the feeling from our industry from technical SEO standpoint right so I asked of course I had to ask I asked again I did this survey uh the technical SEO survey in order to see you if people was feeling the same um I got 280 answers and um I want to share the results today for the first time I was actually publishing the survey that you can now see uh See it out there um not only link from the presentation which by the way I tweeted and share on in in LinkedIn and in TRS and everywhere already just before I got on stage and this is not a tactic for you to start following me there in case you haven't yet but if you want to go ahead and do it now you can do it and you will have all of the resources there directly but in any case the results are in and this is the first time that I I'm going to go through them and not only go through them but also share a little bit of like the let's say the the highlights and potential options that we have have to address the challenges that we are going to see that we are still suffer suffering from a technical IO standpoint right so um first the behavior that I identify most tech seos develop monthly followed by curly technical SEO audits which is great to see that we are currently checking the configuration of our websites and clients uh we tend to use a mix of cloud-based and desktop SEO crawlers and I believe that there's really a radical change the popularization I I remember when cloud-based SEO crawlers was something very very expensive and it seems that now most of us are pretty much using them because it's much more straightforward much more cost effective at the end of the day most of us are also using between two and three craw crawlers to validate uh SEO audits to do analysis to simulate the Goa to which is amazing that we don't over rely only on a single solution or a single tool and the most popular tool surprise surprise that we love to to use and I asked for maybe this was a little bit the wording right asked um for people to tell me like the top three tools that they were using or they love to use for technical SEO analysis and Audits and they mention Google search console too right screamy frog h s brush cybo Chrome de tools go PP insights and a big long tail of other SEO platforms that include some technical SEO related analysis and validation and crawlers and then the other hand also much more specialized let's say technical SEO configuration uh related tools that we troubleshoot or used to trible shoot like GT metrics for example for for Speed or web page test it was great to see it there too cool P page speed insights too uh so it's great to see that well we have all of this let's say availability of resources many more resources that we used to have before and great to see too that the majority of us uh leverage presch craws to automate the validations of site configurations we are already making the moves out of the cloudbased specialty functionality to do this and we also use Su alerting tools a lot of us to be notified when never something changes on the side any technical related configuration or structural content uh configuration is change we are notify the majority also validate the technical SE execution in a test envirment before it is released and unsurprisingly unsurprisingly unfortunately many of us wish to do it but we don't have the capacity to do so uh as well way too many of those responses also it really took my attention that yes more than 90% of the craws are um right now being released by executing JavaScript but only 23% of seos do this followed by % that only are able to do this between 40% and 60% of the time unfortunely I think that this has to do with the credit system that a few crawlers and also at the end of the day time resources constraints being blocked and uh the consumption when we are using desktop crawlers too that this might have so yeah there's that on the other hand a lot of us more than 90% of the crawls also are are being done by integrating with thirdparty SEO metric so to give cont context to the analysis to the audit we integrate with the Google search console Google analytics and so on and the last bit here although most only um let's say enable or are able to enable log file analysis when it is actually necessary unfortunately way too many say that they wish to have access to web web servers log file analysis but they don't it's still a struggle even with the popularization of CDN which pretty much is just an ACC access to the to the SEO with some limitations of course so we don't stuff up change the configurations of anything by yourself but unfortunately this is still a challenge anyway so this is pretty much the overview this is great right it seems that we're advancing that we have access to so many more tools more sophistication more opportunities more automation so we've clearly come a long way when aiting but what about the actual implementation of our recommendations because these were the money is this is where the actual impact is is how we are going to see results and Achieve goals at the end of the day and this was actually my expectation right with all of this l m no code H SEO API accesss it's like oh my God it's like yeah very sophisticated hopefully we're we're in the future already but but realistically sadly shockingly or not when I asked if we were already using Ai and llms to automate Tech SEO task this is see 30% say yes but most of those that say Yes um it was for technical SEO analysis or auditing not for implementation right like for implementation only 20% uh no for implementation it was 13% of the responses and realistically the most popular options were for analysis and auditing and then reporting but literally for for execution or implementation only 30 %. so this is the thing this where we usually tend to have more challenges at the end of the day but there are things that cannot be automated it seems uh fewer have developed their own tools too because I asked how you have you developed your own platforms your own tools your own solutions to eliminate or minimize these sort of challenges that we take uh tend to face and a lot of us have done it for again technical SEO analysis or reporting but most haven't we are not there yet and then when I ask we for which type of task implementation uh uh activities we are using uh some of the two party plugins or CDN H SEO type of of configuration Solutions um or adoms even for platforms or cmss most of us are using it for the all same all same like web speed optimization implementation of canonical TXS structur data JavaScript rendering more exm time UPS so this is good I mean but but they they are sort of like let's say the same sort of scenarios um or activities that we used to have challenges right and the some sort of configurations that we used to have plugins for in WordPress anyway 10 years ago maybe I don't know if we'll have it in the next 10 years given all of the drama going on shockingly there's an industry with more drama than SEO it seems so I feel very actually we really happy about it that is not us at least anyway uh we also use jira and Slack to coordinate with product managers and developers which amazingly I I I never thought that I was going to get so many answers about jira this is great to see at the end of the day we need to use the tools that developers are using so we need to well really coordinate well with them integrate into their continuous workflow on one hand and then most of the technical SEO recommendations shockingly only take between four and six week to get executed my my Harel hello to these people who said that takes more than 16 weeks 10 10 responses with that like I hear you I I see you I have been there bigger companies that that's what happens unfortunately but yes there's that and despite all of this most only see between 40% to 60% of their technical SEO recommendations implemented this is the actual challenge if you ask me right uh most of the responses here 29% of the responses were like I only see between 40% to 60% of my SE recommendations implemented and the next group uh answered that between 60 and 80% which is great only 7% ofoc more than 90% of the SEO recommendations implemented I mean how do we expect to see results if we don't do the stuff that we recommend them to well to improve the and Achieve goals right so of course unsurprisingly when I ask about uh what is the level of difficulty that we are seeing to achieve SEO goals or the technical SEO goals that we look for with our recommendations uh if it is getting more difficult or not it's like most of the answers were well the same as before despite all of this resources or new resources or New Waves of of tools that we have unfortunately it's the same or harder things haven't improved sadly and when I ask the reasons for this I same all again resources constraints prioritization issues lack of understanding or buying from decision makers budget constraints uh some things never seem to change right internal communication or workflow challenges technical complexity so yes although automation seems to have been able to facilitate a few things in our day-to-day in our world flows the reality is that it cannot replace the need of stakeholder support and decision makers byy in which are very Human Solutions at the end of the day or very human decisions right we can see something similar when asking about the biggest Tech SEO challenges in current projects again development of resources constraints JavaScript rendering issues C bies performance optimization client communication buyin and again a mix of resources constraint buyin and then very specific technical um misconfigurations and challenges handling them because of uh whether Legacy system or or new JavaScript Frameworks or scenarios like migrations for in which this type of uh configurations are even more challenging so this was a little bit of my reaction when I went through this last bit of the results of the survey are wi in in 2024 or in 2014 because again it seems that some things in technical SEO uh never changeed and I hope to have I wish to have Dr mad an ability to see the future and past at the same time and sadly no but yes it feels like yeah same old same old right it's like are we really in 2024 here and despite all this technical SEO effort are still highly moderate moderately impactful to SEO goals there's still a point in our work so maybe it is not that bad we will still have a job for a while it seems and um most ofo projects also somehow still achieve results right even if recommendations are not implemented results are there we are get getting the money when it is expected in most cases right and here's the thing how is it possible if we're achieving goals results despite all of these challenges and given that despite all of this bus going around of new platforms new new paradigm of of search of of searching Etc organic search is still the biggest traffic Source still today it doesn't make sense that we don't get money we don't get the approval it make make it make sense it's not fine we clearly still need to better influence and communicate value need and impact of SEO to get that by we have a perception versus reality Challenge in a CEO we are like like I I'm always impressed how the PPC people are able to get all of those budgets even like throwing money they sometimes they don't even know where the clicks are coming from but somehow we still have these very human ISU issues and I understand how we all love to automate stuff but some things need very Human Solutions right and somehow when I ask and I ask look this is very interesting uh from the survey I asked about what are the features or or solutions that you wish that were developed in SEO for technical SEO that haven't been yet created so to the toolmakers here or those who are uh strong enough with your proms uh for uh your to get a little bit of some um artifacts with with cloud people say oh I wish to have ai integration and predictive analysis of recommendations I don't know how they want to keep their jobs but yes somehow this is something that we want to have enhanced reporting and visualization lock file and Crow budget analysis better JavaScript rendering diagnostic solutions that are able to facilitate our life a little bit more cob Bal on PP optimization so yes we are looking for all of this technical automation opportunities and additional Solutions beyond the ones that we already have but this wish L well doesn't necessarily tackle the actual challenge that we have that is this we think or we overthink that the SEO problems will be solved completely by automation when realistically we have a lot of automation already and this automation won't solve a lot of them because they are at the end of the day product problems business problems and problems that have to do with decision making human capacity to give us money and resources at the end of the day and at a very high level the SEO challenge is whether about brand or product right depending on the side size this is something that I really want to highlight uh and I have been highlighting lately and will be doing much more for bigger companies and sites the product execution alignment is the top SEO challenge right like craw budget issues for lar large companies or the back and forth with product and you ask oh we want to improve cor bital let's feature l content in the page yes you can also feature a bland page and have perfect go with vital but you won't sell more with that and we won't achieve actual better rankings and results at the end of the day and revenue right for small companies and sides it's about solving the brand popularity challenge that is the biggest issue and that is how somehow Google excuse themselves uh for to feature Reddit at the top in every single results and F please go and search for learn SEO a click on learning seo. instead of Reddit I think that most of us will do it anyway right it's like the other people that I need to do some request that anyway in terms of su areas then the bigger the side the more important the product Tech Challenge is that is just real right at the beginning we need to focus on backlinks content brand stuff in order to grow it so love it or hate it is a product problem we cannot succeed in on a Sil we cannot succeed by ourselves right we need to rely on other areas deis show makers on stakeholders ability uh to give us resources to approve stuff and the goal is to achieve alignment with all of these areas within the product triangle realistically we are not here we shouldn't necessarily like rain bend the whe there's a there are there are a lot of resources and principles and framework that product people have created in order to solve this particular issue and we just need to be a little bit more aware about it so very very quickly because I am literally getting H very little time but yeah it's not true I still have 10 minutes I I I started later isn't it yes okay with a little bit more time no worries anyway it's true oh my God Mike you're deceiving me what the heck okay okay yes I still have 10 minutes I'm tracking I'm tracking as a good SEO anyway let's go so we don't need to reinvent the whe here we have a lot of resources that prodject manage management people have created even if they are not developers like there are so so many funny memos uh out there memes like making fun of them because what what does the uh developer who's not good at development end up doing like product managements like they can say a lot about that from technical seos too but anyway we need to become their friends don't repeat this to them anyway we can we can de we can let's say integrate ourself in their workflow and better understand what they are doing in their day today especially at bigger companies they have joint application developments sort of interviews and meetings and workshops in order to identify requirements that are functional non functional among these requirements besides usability and accessibility is findability what in whatever platform uh the the product is supposed to be showcase or or share right so agree on what and how you will recommend a report on based on what they actually care about why you hear the show makers or stakeholders stating in these sort of meetings and interviews is key is core and you should work with the product manager manager in order to get an information I created this little sheet version of the Su measurement report planner where I pretty much developed this different metrics and information that I like to collect from decision makers because I will personalize my recommendations my reports and whatever information I give them in order to request resources in order to speak their language and talk about the kpis and goals that they actually care about that are not necessarily SEO we can also create user stories for each SEO recommendation to easily articulate the benefit and the action at an strategic level I wish to see these sort of features more and more in SEO tools right create your user story because this allow us not only to answer some of the most common questions about our recommendations the what the who the why and but also it really facilitates at different levels very strategic level allow us to pretty much connect with the needs of the products and show why these recommendations are important but also to specify clearly the acceptant criteria to consider the the recommendations to be done I have had so many instances of developers telling me AR is already done it was not true it's a lie why are you wasting my time if there's clear clear criteria we that you should agreed on it's great that it's also great when you check and it's actually done on the dev environment but then it is released and somehow it's not right love it anyway this that stuff can still happen is why you need to check before and after but anyway this should be ideal uh the level of granularity of stories and tasks then also help coordination also help communication we can also use the dri model to specify and to assess which are the highest reach impact confidence and lower effort prioritization for our recommendations in a way that they are already working with and in a way that decision makers actually understand because this is a very common model with product manager at the end of the day and here where it comes like okay okay we will need to tie the visibility but also the cost Effectiveness and the impact that you will have in terms of traffic and revenue using current conversion rates Etc and this is where we need to actually get comfortable with forecast and amazingly we now have solutions that are very easy to use so for example I have I am a fan of the simple ml for Sheets add-on completely free relying uh and using both the ARA and ETS model which which are actually good models to forecast with it's completely free and you can use it with your Google search console data and you can add incremental values there quite easily is not rocket science it's something that any of us can use and is well accessible to all of us so you can also copy this template that I have created for my prioritization system using the D model for SEO recommendations and and specifications and then we can use for example something called the situation complication resolution framework that product manager l to U use whenever they are getting Buy in from decision makers and this will add the needed goals and B context to each one of the recommendations and help to secure report support because we provide context and the why and what we are going to achieve from each recommendation an action and of course for every recommendation I will highly highly recommend to use the MTO pyramid in order to add supporting arguments supporting facts to each one of the actions that we propose both again this is something that they are using on a day today if you ask your product manager so again these might be soft skills but these are the soft skills that are very well needed and the type of I would say features and functionalities that I wish that there was a layer of in our tools to facilitate and develop this sort of incentive isas let's say to develop this sort of activities more on our day-to-day because these are the ones that are going to guarantee or at least increment the the chances to get support from decision makers to actually implement the stuff that we're recommending and uh we will never realistically automate buying this is the thing we are looking always to automate stuff to improve the visibility of what we do but at the end of the day we cannot automate the human nature of business and the support that we need uh to our Channel at the end of the day especially the when we need a lot of executions that are technical related and we're just so many stakeholders and so many says right it's time to change the narrative to get our Tech SEO recommendations executed for Success that is my whole point this is hopefully also the point that you get from there hopefully the those decision makers not decision but also those who Implement stuff I see a lot of tool makers here they also integrate more and more this layer of information uh the aggregation we not only traffic but also Revenue conversions that will be nice in order to provide these additional features that we all needed in order to get our work done implemented our results in uh if you want more of these insights by the way and maybe you this is a little bit of my analysis right and my my take on them but maybe you have completely different takes because we are all like this in SEO it depends right and you have the results here in the SEO phot technical SEO survey that is already published I publish it today at 400 a.m. thank you very much you can go and take a look at it lots of results lots of insights lots of wishes from SEO of new tools new features new capacities in our day today and I hope that you have found this useful thank you very much",
        "cleaned_text": "thank you thank you thank you very much that was very kind of mike i have to say also something like still independent too not bought by anybody at this point like a few of a few of us left uh just kidding this this s its sad you know when i want to come up with jokes and nobody laughes so no worries hopefully the last one hopefully the last one but yes im so very excited to be here um first time in uh rally um very very surprised and i love it i have mentioned to a couple of people that its like the typical uh city that you see in u in us movies uh so its like yeah this not new york or la right this like typical h so very nice and very looking forward to share with you today and uh today i come to talk something that i believe that all of us can feel identified right like the challenges that we unfortunately l are going through in in seo something that uh we literally need to fight with and struggle with and coincidentally i ran into an seo friend who i started with in the seo work back in 2007 and i feel very old now uh and uh literally since that time when i started doing seo i dont think that i have never felt that the pace of changes was like this right all the uncertainty too around it like oh we have ai overviews because all of the sudden google has realized that they need to keep up with llms and of course they need to integrate it in their current interface to keep making money with ads somehow and then sir gpt the prototype is out there and just a few days ago they mentioned that they will start to integrate it it after testing it and then all of a sudden maybe that doesnt matter because gen z and younger people are searching in tik tok and um unfortunately it doesnt seem that the reliability of the compan is an issue there but yes theres that so it has never been harder to sell a co i as around to seo seo f subscribers a few months back on a survey that i did about seo consulting is has also never been harder to achieve seo goals uh because of all of this uncertainty among the common issues that we know that we face on seo day today but llms also has opened the doors to so much awesomeness right the automation in our seo work no i am not referring to this one sorry this was supposed to be a joke too um the content automation ai content junk was not necessarily like the purpose of uh the benefits of automation that we could all look for uh but i was um referring to the ones that im going to explain in a bit sadly this is what at the end of the day has make it harder and harder from a technical seo standpoint for google to start indexing more content especially new content right but on the other hand we have this awesomeness right um so many new people have started to automate stuff uh i see every week literally because i go and take a look at the latest tools the latest scripts etc to include them in the tool section of seo new scripts new tools new validators from people who were not coding like a year and a half ago and they started to do it thanks to chat gpt sh uh thanks to all of the integrations that crawlers like for example screaming frog has and they can connect to apis and literally with cla artifacts and chat gpt canvas there are no excuses right i have been playing around quite a few some forecasting some validations here um integrating with open ai um also apis making it easier to validate and assess a few of the things that were challeng more challenging before so we also have access to seo solutions that solve some of the some top challenges in technical seos uh realistically right so at the end of the day we should be okay too even better not because of all of these waves of llms but tools that we used to have before have taken a new level so for example we have tools for implementing internal linking a scale structured data scale um even to develop knowledge raft directly from to our website just a few clicks away in links they do a great job at that we have cdn now that allow us to change http headers uh to implement a lot of not only configurations to improve speed but a execute reil rides to implement a lot of stuff developing seo ab testing at scale much more easily to real time seo alerting tools to monitor any updates of key technical seo configurations cloudbased crawlers with detail reports also featuring the raw versus render gap of javascript client side based javascript at scale um seo platforms that allow us to check out changes not only for your own pages but also any side page hello amazing new feature or relatively new feature from asf by the way uh so yeah all of a sudden i feel like well but this should be fine isnt it we have all of these new features so much awesomeness that we didnt used to have uh back in the day so i was like but is this the feeling from our industry from technical seo standpoint right so i asked of course i had to ask i asked again i did this survey uh the technical seo survey in order to see you if people was feeling the same um i got 280 answers and um i want to share the results today for the first time i was actually publishing the survey that you can now see uh see it out there um not only link from the presentation which by the way i tweeted and share on in in linkedin and in trs and everywhere already just before i got on stage and this is not a tactic for you to start following me there in case you havent yet but if you want to go ahead and do it now you can do it and you will have all of the resources there directly but in any case the results are in and this is the first time that i im going to go through them and not only go through them but also share a little bit of like the lets say the the highlights and potential options that we have have to address the challenges that we are going to see that we are still suffer suffering from a technical io standpoint right so um first the behavior that i identify most tech seos develop monthly followed by curly technical seo audits which is great to see that we are currently checking the configuration of our websites and clients uh we tend to use a mix of cloudbased and desktop seo crawlers and i believe that theres really a radical change the popularization i i remember when cloudbased seo crawlers was something very very expensive and it seems that now most of us are pretty much using them because its much more straightforward much more cost effective at the end of the day most of us are also using between two and three craw crawlers to validate uh seo audits to do analysis to simulate the goa to which is amazing that we dont over rely only on a single solution or a single tool and the most popular tool surprise surprise that we love to to use and i asked for maybe this was a little bit the wording right asked um for people to tell me like the top three tools that they were using or they love to use for technical seo analysis and audits and they mention google search console too right screamy frog h s brush cybo chrome de tools go pp insights and a big long tail of other seo platforms that include some technical seo related analysis and validation and crawlers and then the other hand also much more specialized lets say technical seo configuration uh related tools that we troubleshoot or used to trible shoot like gt metrics for example for for speed or web page test it was great to see it there too cool p page speed insights too uh so its great to see that well we have all of this lets say availability of resources many more resources that we used to have before and great to see too that the majority of us uh leverage presch craws to automate the validations of site configurations we are already making the moves out of the cloudbased specialty functionality to do this and we also use su alerting tools a lot of us to be notified when never something changes on the side any technical related configuration or structural content uh configuration is change we are notify the majority also validate the technical se execution in a test envirment before it is released and unsurprisingly unsurprisingly unfortunately many of us wish to do it but we dont have the capacity to do so uh as well way too many of those responses also it really took my attention that yes more than 90 of the craws are um right now being released by executing javascript but only 23 of seos do this followed by  that only are able to do this between 40 and 60 of the time unfortunely i think that this has to do with the credit system that a few crawlers and also at the end of the day time resources constraints being blocked and uh the consumption when we are using desktop crawlers too that this might have so yeah theres that on the other hand a lot of us more than 90 of the crawls also are are being done by integrating with thirdparty seo metric so to give cont context to the analysis to the audit we integrate with the google search console google analytics and so on and the last bit here although most only um lets say enable or are able to enable log file analysis when it is actually necessary unfortunately way too many say that they wish to have access to web web servers log file analysis but they dont its still a struggle even with the popularization of cdn which pretty much is just an acc access to the to the seo with some limitations of course so we dont stuff up change the configurations of anything by yourself but unfortunately this is still a challenge anyway so this is pretty much the overview this is great right it seems that were advancing that we have access to so many more tools more sophistication more opportunities more automation so weve clearly come a long way when aiting but what about the actual implementation of our recommendations because these were the money is this is where the actual impact is is how we are going to see results and achieve goals at the end of the day and this was actually my expectation right with all of this l m no code h seo api accesss its like oh my god its like yeah very sophisticated hopefully were were in the future already but but realistically sadly shockingly or not when i asked if we were already using ai and llms to automate tech seo task this is see 30 say yes but most of those that say yes um it was for technical seo analysis or auditing not for implementation right like for implementation only 20 uh no for implementation it was 13 of the responses and realistically the most popular options were for analysis and auditing and then reporting but literally for for execution or implementation only 30  so this is the thing this where we usually tend to have more challenges at the end of the day but there are things that cannot be automated it seems uh fewer have developed their own tools too because i asked how you have you developed your own platforms your own tools your own solutions to eliminate or minimize these sort of challenges that we take uh tend to face and a lot of us have done it for again technical seo analysis or reporting but most havent we are not there yet and then when i ask we for which type of task implementation uh uh activities we are using uh some of the two party plugins or cdn h seo type of of configuration solutions um or adoms even for platforms or cmss most of us are using it for the all same all same like web speed optimization implementation of canonical txs structur data javascript rendering more exm time ups so this is good i mean but but they they are sort of like lets say the same sort of scenarios um or activities that we used to have challenges right and the some sort of configurations that we used to have plugins for in wordpress anyway 10 years ago maybe i dont know if well have it in the next 10 years given all of the drama going on shockingly theres an industry with more drama than seo it seems so i feel very actually we really happy about it that is not us at least anyway uh we also use jira and slack to coordinate with product managers and developers which amazingly i i i never thought that i was going to get so many answers about jira this is great to see at the end of the day we need to use the tools that developers are using so we need to well really coordinate well with them integrate into their continuous workflow on one hand and then most of the technical seo recommendations shockingly only take between four and six week to get executed my my harel hello to these people who said that takes more than 16 weeks 10 10 responses with that like i hear you i i see you i have been there bigger companies that thats what happens unfortunately but yes theres that and despite all of this most only see between 40 to 60 of their technical seo recommendations implemented this is the actual challenge if you ask me right uh most of the responses here 29 of the responses were like i only see between 40 to 60 of my se recommendations implemented and the next group uh answered that between 60 and 80 which is great only 7 ofoc more than 90 of the seo recommendations implemented i mean how do we expect to see results if we dont do the stuff that we recommend them to well to improve the and achieve goals right so of course unsurprisingly when i ask about uh what is the level of difficulty that we are seeing to achieve seo goals or the technical seo goals that we look for with our recommendations uh if it is getting more difficult or not its like most of the answers were well the same as before despite all of this resources or new resources or new waves of of tools that we have unfortunately its the same or harder things havent improved sadly and when i ask the reasons for this i same all again resources constraints prioritization issues lack of understanding or buying from decision makers budget constraints uh some things never seem to change right internal communication or workflow challenges technical complexity so yes although automation seems to have been able to facilitate a few things in our daytoday in our world flows the reality is that it cannot replace the need of stakeholder support and decision makers byy in which are very human solutions at the end of the day or very human decisions right we can see something similar when asking about the biggest tech seo challenges in current projects again development of resources constraints javascript rendering issues c bies performance optimization client communication buyin and again a mix of resources constraint buyin and then very specific technical um misconfigurations and challenges handling them because of uh whether legacy system or or new javascript frameworks or scenarios like migrations for in which this type of uh configurations are even more challenging so this was a little bit of my reaction when i went through this last bit of the results of the survey are wi in in 2024 or in 2014 because again it seems that some things in technical seo uh never changeed and i hope to have i wish to have dr mad an ability to see the future and past at the same time and sadly no but yes it feels like yeah same old same old right its like are we really in 2024 here and despite all this technical seo effort are still highly moderate moderately impactful to seo goals theres still a point in our work so maybe it is not that bad we will still have a job for a while it seems and um most ofo projects also somehow still achieve results right even if recommendations are not implemented results are there we are get getting the money when it is expected in most cases right and heres the thing how is it possible if were achieving goals results despite all of these challenges and given that despite all of this bus going around of new platforms new new paradigm of of search of of searching etc organic search is still the biggest traffic source still today it doesnt make sense that we dont get money we dont get the approval it make make it make sense its not fine we clearly still need to better influence and communicate value need and impact of seo to get that by we have a perception versus reality challenge in a ceo we are like like i im always impressed how the ppc people are able to get all of those budgets even like throwing money they sometimes they dont even know where the clicks are coming from but somehow we still have these very human isu issues and i understand how we all love to automate stuff but some things need very human solutions right and somehow when i ask and i ask look this is very interesting uh from the survey i asked about what are the features or or solutions that you wish that were developed in seo for technical seo that havent been yet created so to the toolmakers here or those who are uh strong enough with your proms uh for uh your to get a little bit of some um artifacts with with cloud people say oh i wish to have ai integration and predictive analysis of recommendations i dont know how they want to keep their jobs but yes somehow this is something that we want to have enhanced reporting and visualization lock file and crow budget analysis better javascript rendering diagnostic solutions that are able to facilitate our life a little bit more cob bal on pp optimization so yes we are looking for all of this technical automation opportunities and additional solutions beyond the ones that we already have but this wish l well doesnt necessarily tackle the actual challenge that we have that is this we think or we overthink that the seo problems will be solved completely by automation when realistically we have a lot of automation already and this automation wont solve a lot of them because they are at the end of the day product problems business problems and problems that have to do with decision making human capacity to give us money and resources at the end of the day and at a very high level the seo challenge is whether about brand or product right depending on the side size this is something that i really want to highlight uh and i have been highlighting lately and will be doing much more for bigger companies and sites the product execution alignment is the top seo challenge right like craw budget issues for lar large companies or the back and forth with product and you ask oh we want to improve cor bital lets feature l content in the page yes you can also feature a bland page and have perfect go with vital but you wont sell more with that and we wont achieve actual better rankings and results at the end of the day and revenue right for small companies and sides its about solving the brand popularity challenge that is the biggest issue and that is how somehow google excuse themselves uh for to feature reddit at the top in every single results and f please go and search for learn seo a click on learning seo instead of reddit i think that most of us will do it anyway right its like the other people that i need to do some request that anyway in terms of su areas then the bigger the side the more important the product tech challenge is that is just real right at the beginning we need to focus on backlinks content brand stuff in order to grow it so love it or hate it is a product problem we cannot succeed in on a sil we cannot succeed by ourselves right we need to rely on other areas deis show makers on stakeholders ability uh to give us resources to approve stuff and the goal is to achieve alignment with all of these areas within the product triangle realistically we are not here we shouldnt necessarily like rain bend the whe theres a there are there are a lot of resources and principles and framework that product people have created in order to solve this particular issue and we just need to be a little bit more aware about it so very very quickly because i am literally getting h very little time but yeah its not true i still have 10 minutes i i i started later isnt it yes okay with a little bit more time no worries anyway its true oh my god mike youre deceiving me what the heck okay okay yes i still have 10 minutes im tracking im tracking as a good seo anyway lets go so we dont need to reinvent the whe here we have a lot of resources that prodject manage management people have created even if they are not developers like there are so so many funny memos uh out there memes like making fun of them because what what does the uh developer whos not good at development end up doing like product managements like they can say a lot about that from technical seos too but anyway we need to become their friends dont repeat this to them anyway we can we can de we can lets say integrate ourself in their workflow and better understand what they are doing in their day today especially at bigger companies they have joint application developments sort of interviews and meetings and workshops in order to identify requirements that are functional non functional among these requirements besides usability and accessibility is findability what in whatever platform uh the the product is supposed to be showcase or or share right so agree on what and how you will recommend a report on based on what they actually care about why you hear the show makers or stakeholders stating in these sort of meetings and interviews is key is core and you should work with the product manager manager in order to get an information i created this little sheet version of the su measurement report planner where i pretty much developed this different metrics and information that i like to collect from decision makers because i will personalize my recommendations my reports and whatever information i give them in order to request resources in order to speak their language and talk about the kpis and goals that they actually care about that are not necessarily seo we can also create user stories for each seo recommendation to easily articulate the benefit and the action at an strategic level i wish to see these sort of features more and more in seo tools right create your user story because this allow us not only to answer some of the most common questions about our recommendations the what the who the why and but also it really facilitates at different levels very strategic level allow us to pretty much connect with the needs of the products and show why these recommendations are important but also to specify clearly the acceptant criteria to consider the the recommendations to be done i have had so many instances of developers telling me ar is already done it was not true its a lie why are you wasting my time if theres clear clear criteria we that you should agreed on its great that its also great when you check and its actually done on the dev environment but then it is released and somehow its not right love it anyway this that stuff can still happen is why you need to check before and after but anyway this should be ideal uh the level of granularity of stories and tasks then also help coordination also help communication we can also use the dri model to specify and to assess which are the highest reach impact confidence and lower effort prioritization for our recommendations in a way that they are already working with and in a way that decision makers actually understand because this is a very common model with product manager at the end of the day and here where it comes like okay okay we will need to tie the visibility but also the cost effectiveness and the impact that you will have in terms of traffic and revenue using current conversion rates etc and this is where we need to actually get comfortable with forecast and amazingly we now have solutions that are very easy to use so for example i have i am a fan of the simple ml for sheets addon completely free relying uh and using both the ara and ets model which which are actually good models to forecast with its completely free and you can use it with your google search console data and you can add incremental values there quite easily is not rocket science its something that any of us can use and is well accessible to all of us so you can also copy this template that i have created for my prioritization system using the d model for seo recommendations and and specifications and then we can use for example something called the situation complication resolution framework that product manager l to u use whenever they are getting buy in from decision makers and this will add the needed goals and b context to each one of the recommendations and help to secure report support because we provide context and the why and what we are going to achieve from each recommendation an action and of course for every recommendation i will highly highly recommend to use the mto pyramid in order to add supporting arguments supporting facts to each one of the actions that we propose both again this is something that they are using on a day today if you ask your product manager so again these might be soft skills but these are the soft skills that are very well needed and the type of i would say features and functionalities that i wish that there was a layer of in our tools to facilitate and develop this sort of incentive isas lets say to develop this sort of activities more on our daytoday because these are the ones that are going to guarantee or at least increment the the chances to get support from decision makers to actually implement the stuff that were recommending and uh we will never realistically automate buying this is the thing we are looking always to automate stuff to improve the visibility of what we do but at the end of the day we cannot automate the human nature of business and the support that we need uh to our channel at the end of the day especially the when we need a lot of executions that are technical related and were just so many stakeholders and so many says right its time to change the narrative to get our tech seo recommendations executed for success that is my whole point this is hopefully also the point that you get from there hopefully the those decision makers not decision but also those who implement stuff i see a lot of tool makers here they also integrate more and more this layer of information uh the aggregation we not only traffic but also revenue conversions that will be nice in order to provide these additional features that we all needed in order to get our work done implemented our results in uh if you want more of these insights by the way and maybe you this is a little bit of my analysis right and my my take on them but maybe you have completely different takes because we are all like this in seo it depends right and you have the results here in the seo phot technical seo survey that is already published i publish it today at 400 am thank you very much you can go and take a look at it lots of results lots of insights lots of wishes from seo of new tools new features new capacities in our day today and i hope that you have found this useful thank you very much",

        "raw_text": "all right thanks for letting us sort through AV issues and I guess uh give a round of applause for these guys uh figuring this all out I've been behind that and it's not fun it's very stressful all right so yeah I'm the senior SEO manager at weed maps I've been there for a couple of years and previously worked at a bunch of agencies um including in-house at Deep crawl where I worked on the Professional Service profession Services team working with all kinds of large clients like car gurus artsy Etc um I'm excited this is my first inperson conference because I started speaking during the pandemic and they were all cancelled and made virtual so it's really nice to feel the energy of this space all right so what does this mean basically I uh listen to a lot of great presentations about how to build a business case for engineering product and designed resources for SEO projects again I came from agencies I was like okay I'm tucked into marketing at this org I can't get anything done how do I build this business case and I watched a lot of great presentations and I had a lot of assumptions going in I was like okay we were going to get these resources and we're going to immediately start getting progress on all these new initiatives yes we have years of tech Deb to work through we'll do that all first and then we'll be able to start running through with new things uh but the reality is is I quickly realized that all my resources were being eaten up by Tech debt in fact the engineering team I worked with they said we're the janitors of the engineering department here at weed maps we're just cleaning up other people's code all the time and I was like yeah we are this is a huge problem so I asked myself some questions about tech debt versus new features and where our time was going I asked myself how many tickets for Tech SEO um like Tech debt tickets were filed in the past quarter how many Sprint points went to Tech debt versus new features in the last quarter and how many new features for SEO were released on schedule and the answers were appalling we had 30 plus tickets uh that were like net new new problems a third of total Sprint points were being just dedicated towards Tech debt and we could not keep up with it at that level um and none of our projects were released on time uh yeah if you work in house this is probably a common story so I was like okay there's clearly a problem with how we're finding Tech debt um and really our problem was that it was all really reactive so what I'm not saying here is that you don't need to audit uh you absolutely need to audit uh that's why I have site bulb Cloud crawler side note um Gareth and Patrick are great site bulb Cloud crawler is amazing um they did not pay me to say that I paid them for me to say that um so yeah everything we were doing was very reactive uh we were looking at site buold monthly GSC weekly and we were doing manual checks when Engineers thought to pull us in but the problem was all of this code was already visible to search engin so it was already harming us before we would even see it and that's how we ended up with situations like this anyone want to guess y our traffic did that no so we rolled out new product category pages and it didn't go great um the team did not ask for good SEO input uh and the input they gave or we gave they ignored that was when Google started crawling the page from Houston this is what the page looked like and so what would happen cannabis is heavily regionalized and so Google went from crawling in Michigan to crawling in Houston and so they went from a page that had products in it to a page with no products in it and they said oh this is a soft 404 and they took it out of the index and so this cycle just kept happening again and again and again um the thing about cannabis is it is heavily regionalized so because it's federally illegal that means you cannot cross state borders with it and so if I own a cannabis business in California I sell gummies and hey New York has gone wrecked legal I want to start selling the gummies there I can't just you know do a a distribution agreement like we do with beer um I'm from Richmond so we have the veil and now you can get the veil beer other places yay you can't do that with weed no I've got to go I've got to set up my own growroom operation in New York that's probably going to take a year to get any sort of quality product I then have to have all my industrial equipment to create the gummies there in New York and then I have to change all my packaging and maybe quantities to comply with local laws and so it's really really regionalized and Engineers really didn't think about that neither did product when they were putting together the website weed map started out as a directory based website and has moved over towards Ecommerce and so the marketplace being regionalized and having to comply with different laws causes a lot of issues but there were really no QA checks in place for things like this so that's why the traffic is all over the place why we have a roller coaster on this page um and this is being fixed but this is a great uh an issue to highlight the fact that like all projects at the org were having these kinds of problems so we had these dedicated resources they were all being eaten up by SEO regressions so Tech Deb's always going to be a problem so I said hey how can we reduce this negative impact and actually start working on new features to gain traffic and the solution is moving to a more proactive method so we rolled out this four-prong solution to reduce Tech debt so adding um automated test to our cicd pipeline adding SEO sign off in business processes adding SEO QA for high-risk tickets and then finally engineering education I'm going to walk you through these things so part one or part A cicd automated test what is cicd uh it stands for continuous integration and continuous deliver Y and essentially it allows Engineers to constantly be deploying code you're not waiting until 3:00 p.m. on Thursday to release all your tickets if you work for a large org they're working on thousands of tickets each week so you want to make sure that all that code is being released to the website of course the critical component here is that they're checking for bugs before it goes to your production environment so some questions you might want to ask yourself does your organization have this if you work a large tech company inhouse the answer is likely yes um and does your company have automated test not for SEO unless you configured them yourself and are working on maintaining them uh when we started working with our QE team they were like oh we should check canonical tag shouldn't we yeah yeah you should uh so how do you configure it like I just mentioned we had to work with our QA and QE team on this and there are some vendors like deep crawl who have special tools for this but I would recommend checking with your own teams first because these tools are limited to the tests that they'll like that they can run they cost money it takes time to get them integrated in your systems and if you work for a large company you know how long procurement takes so I worked with the QE team and what we did is we outlined all kinds of test that we wanted to set up we listed out all our web surfaces and example URLs that was pretty easy because we just took our keyword mapping information we checked uh we made a list of all the critical HTML elements that we wanted to check for errors and then we talked about um other special things by Page type and then finally Regional tests are very very important and that really was not something that QE had set up initially so we added a lot of regionalized tests in there too so we're checking from Houston Michigan from uh LA from New York City all the markets that really matter for uh cannabis and we use playright for our QE test at weed maps and so this is where we set this up we met weekly with our QE Engineers on configuring these and uh I actually staffed for this so I have a full-time Tech SEO on my team he was responsible for creating these initial tests um fantastic and then maintaining them so um these are living documents they're checking code on the site and so so if you go and update your title tag across a template you need to make sure your test remembers that or else obviously it's going to flag an error so that that's one thing it's stopping bad code from making it to the website very good what this doesn't do is keep Engineers from spending time building bad code that won't work for googlebot so we started working with our product development process to get more buyin so uh typically the business process is kind of look something like this there's a business requirements development phase where you have to get approvals to make sure that the project you're proposing meets business goals if that works you move into the product requirement development phase where you actually outline everything that you need for that project once that happens design and Engineering happens and then finally you go to market so what areas does SEO need to be involved in I would say at least these three and in other cases you may be providing data for the business requirements development section so our PRD phase was a hot mess it was super vague every PM was making different templates for it uh they weren't even outlining like which URLs were being affected and so we would get to the go to market phase and I'd be like whoa whoa whoa you just introduced 50,000 new parameters we can't do that uh and so it would cause thrash at the end of projects uh and it was also a problem for other teams too Le goal uh Revenue they'd be like hey you didn't ask us about this feature this is not going to work for how we make money so we totally overdid the uh PRD requirements phas so there's a template it has all relevant information for stakeholders including things like this Google bot user story and acceptance criteria so this is a part of every single one of our web based projects it just says Hey unless the project specifically tells you to change these things do not touch them uh and you notice facets and filters is there because that's a that's a big one for my company uh so I would highly encourage you to create some sort of item like this so we have a Google doc that we iframe in into Confluence where our prds live and then finally Project Specific requirements so if you need a Content block if you need headers specific to the new page we also add that in here so we get very very specific up front so so that engineers and designers know what they're building then we work with them throughout that phase or through all the phases to make sure that the requirements are being met so we're not wasting time and then finally at go to market um we're asking does the solution meet those product requirements and also did you go outside the product requirements so uh recently California changed laws uh disposable Vape vape pens now have to be called allinone or something different because people people were throwing these batteries in the garbage and you're not supposed to do that so they had to they had a whole lawsuit about it so we had to change our language on the website on certain pages but they overstepped a little bit by accident and did it on all our pages and then what do you know we aren't ranking for disposable Vape pins anymore so that's also a critical step make sure it doesn't overstep the bounds of the project requirements all right so we've done two critical things stop bad code from going to the website and um freed up engineering time on like these projects for our whole org and now I need some water all right sweet but there's a whole another class of tickets that also cost Tech de for our org and these are things that are not part of these larger business initiatives things like software updates legal compliance small projects and all kinds of bug fixes so how do we ensure that those those don't also cause Tech debt um these were a huge problem for us because again a lot of these go back to Regions and how regions interact with sales all kinds of complex things and so they're like oh this is just a little Tech change and it's like well actually now no one in Manhattan can order weed so that's a problem so we introduced jro Fields so all tickets that might impact organic traffic are marked yes for SEO review and then once we review it we can change that value to yes on SEO reviewed we have a dashboard that tells us everything that's coming up for um new Sprints so that we can manage capacity and turnaround time and then um the real information here that you is critical you got to have someone accountable for adding QA to these tickets uh we talked with engineering managers and I'll talk in a minute about our education there but it's critical that someone is accountable for this and probably isn't going to be an SEO we have I think about 2,000 tickets each week that we're going through and it would I've I've audited all of them and it is like 4 hours for each Sprint it's it's a lot of time and it's a lot of like Ruby this and ruby gems and I'm like I don't know what any of this means and this is a waste of my time and everyone's time so you probably don't need to be looking at every ticket um but somebody does need to be accountable and then critically SEO uh we have the final say if these tickets actually get to go to production if SEO reviewed equals no it blocks it from being deployed until they have a conversation with us so then we communicated that with all the teams that needed to know engineering product design bizops Etc but the critical question is do engineering managers actually know what matters for Uso to tag these tickets because this is obviously going to be a complete failure if nobody tags Us in so we went through a whole engineering education Series in three parts um Wiki documentation uh actually communicating with them directly and then as I eluded auditing Sprints and then some continued education so engineering Wiki documentation so I worked with engineering managers to put this documentation about what matters for SEO and then the whole QA process in their Wiki so critically I did not put that in like our section for us I made it very accessible for engineers and in fact this is a link to the documentation about what matters for SEO so I made it really really easy when engineering managers are like clicking through their tickets looking planning out that next Sprint they're like oh does this one have an SEO impact okay let me check and they can go back to that documentation I then went around to all of the engineering groups to talk to them about our issues with tech debt they were aware but they appreciated hearing about it and then educating them on Crawl render index just critical things that they needed to understand and then a conversation of regions and URLs versus surfaces because we also have an app and so a lot of these Engineers who are used to the apps didn't realize things like filter parameters if you have a lot of them can cause lots of problems um and yeah we've been able to clean up a lot of things because of that okay so so I then audited our Sprints as I said each one of them I think it was about 4 hours for each Sprints and that was even with me doing some heavy skimming um and then we realized some of those tickets did fall through the cracks uh as I mentioned like region stuff there were some things with our business operations team that I needed to address some process flow issues within jira and now what I'm doing is I'm going around later this month to complete a secondary round of education for engineers about the kinds of things that were missed things like regions so I do have a couple of tips for getting Buy in from Engineers first of all meet with leadership first um and then I met with the engineering managers um to really get there by and go over the kinds of problems we were having and the solutions um I made it very clear that I was here to try to solve the problem we all knew there was a problem and I wanted to solve it and I framed it as a Time Savings Initiative for them uh that kept them from having to do code reversions and that it was a thrash avoidance technique they were all very aware that none of these projects were launching on time they hated that they hated having to come back and work on things later they also want their projects to be successful and then I explained the other things we were doing the playright test the the the cicd test and the uh work with our uh product development process to reduce Tech debt oh and then I asked for their help so so they were extremely receptive to this I I expected them to be like H we don't want to be responsible for that but no they were all in they were very excited about fixing these things step five velocity to the Moon um so we're always going to have Tech debt tickets that's just how it is there's always going to be problems uh but now we have processes in place to catch those before they go to production and also to catch things much more rapidly once they do go to production if there's a bug so we've seen some major improvements in the first quarter since roll out and again we're still adapting these processes things like that Google bot user Story Each time there's a problem I go back and say hey do we need to add something new to this I added breadcrumbs to that list a couple of weeks ago because I saw a design that didn't have breadcrumbs and I was like yep that's on me I didn't say not to not to not remove them and then so what we've seen is our high impact SEO regression bugs have been cut in half um our staff Engineers are very happy about that because they aren't being pulled off of their other important projects to fix things that are critical Engineers are proactively pulling us into ticket QA and our Google bot user story is an all current web initiatives there were some unexpected improvements too which was better cross team collaboration across the org um engineering product design and legal we had conversations with all of them when we were talking about business processes and issues and all of those teams also had expressed issues with the current process flows so just coming there and presenting a solution to the problems that everyone saw caused there to be a lot more um buyin at an org level and also we ran this education series uh org wide so yeah I talked with the engineers first but I also talked to product managers business operations and told them hey these are the problems we're having with crawl render index and why it actually matters um because there were a lot of misconceptions everybody's like oh yeah we SEO that I'm like what cuz you added it H1 like what so yeah this this was good so yeah if you are having problems with all your engineering resources being eaten up by Tech debt and you don't have these four components in place I would highly recommend that you add automated test to your cicd pipeline get SEO sign off in business processes have some sort of method for all those other tickets that slip through the cracks and finally educate your engineers they probably really will be on board with you if you try to frame it as problem solving thanks [Applause]",
        "cleaned_text": "all right thanks for letting us sort through av issues and i guess uh give a round of applause for these guys uh figuring this all out ive been behind that and its not fun its very stressful all right so yeah im the senior seo manager at weed maps ive been there for a couple of years and previously worked at a bunch of agencies um including inhouse at deep crawl where i worked on the professional service profession services team working with all kinds of large clients like car gurus artsy etc um im excited this is my first inperson conference because i started speaking during the pandemic and they were all cancelled and made virtual so its really nice to feel the energy of this space all right so what does this mean basically i uh listen to a lot of great presentations about how to build a business case for engineering product and designed resources for seo projects again i came from agencies i was like okay im tucked into marketing at this org i cant get anything done how do i build this business case and i watched a lot of great presentations and i had a lot of assumptions going in i was like okay we were going to get these resources and were going to immediately start getting progress on all these new initiatives yes we have years of tech deb to work through well do that all first and then well be able to start running through with new things uh but the reality is is i quickly realized that all my resources were being eaten up by tech debt in fact the engineering team i worked with they said were the janitors of the engineering department here at weed maps were just cleaning up other peoples code all the time and i was like yeah we are this is a huge problem so i asked myself some questions about tech debt versus new features and where our time was going i asked myself how many tickets for tech seo um like tech debt tickets were filed in the past quarter how many sprint points went to tech debt versus new features in the last quarter and how many new features for seo were released on schedule and the answers were appalling we had 30 plus tickets uh that were like net new new problems a third of total sprint points were being just dedicated towards tech debt and we could not keep up with it at that level um and none of our projects were released on time uh yeah if you work in house this is probably a common story so i was like okay theres clearly a problem with how were finding tech debt um and really our problem was that it was all really reactive so what im not saying here is that you dont need to audit uh you absolutely need to audit uh thats why i have site bulb cloud crawler side note um gareth and patrick are great site bulb cloud crawler is amazing um they did not pay me to say that i paid them for me to say that um so yeah everything we were doing was very reactive uh we were looking at site buold monthly gsc weekly and we were doing manual checks when engineers thought to pull us in but the problem was all of this code was already visible to search engin so it was already harming us before we would even see it and thats how we ended up with situations like this anyone want to guess y our traffic did that no so we rolled out new product category pages and it didnt go great um the team did not ask for good seo input uh and the input they gave or we gave they ignored that was when google started crawling the page from houston this is what the page looked like and so what would happen cannabis is heavily regionalized and so google went from crawling in michigan to crawling in houston and so they went from a page that had products in it to a page with no products in it and they said oh this is a soft 404 and they took it out of the index and so this cycle just kept happening again and again and again um the thing about cannabis is it is heavily regionalized so because its federally illegal that means you cannot cross state borders with it and so if i own a cannabis business in california i sell gummies and hey new york has gone wrecked legal i want to start selling the gummies there i cant just you know do a a distribution agreement like we do with beer um im from richmond so we have the veil and now you can get the veil beer other places yay you cant do that with weed no ive got to go ive got to set up my own growroom operation in new york thats probably going to take a year to get any sort of quality product i then have to have all my industrial equipment to create the gummies there in new york and then i have to change all my packaging and maybe quantities to comply with local laws and so its really really regionalized and engineers really didnt think about that neither did product when they were putting together the website weed map started out as a directory based website and has moved over towards ecommerce and so the marketplace being regionalized and having to comply with different laws causes a lot of issues but there were really no qa checks in place for things like this so thats why the traffic is all over the place why we have a roller coaster on this page um and this is being fixed but this is a great uh an issue to highlight the fact that like all projects at the org were having these kinds of problems so we had these dedicated resources they were all being eaten up by seo regressions so tech debs always going to be a problem so i said hey how can we reduce this negative impact and actually start working on new features to gain traffic and the solution is moving to a more proactive method so we rolled out this fourprong solution to reduce tech debt so adding um automated test to our cicd pipeline adding seo sign off in business processes adding seo qa for highrisk tickets and then finally engineering education im going to walk you through these things so part one or part a cicd automated test what is cicd uh it stands for continuous integration and continuous deliver y and essentially it allows engineers to constantly be deploying code youre not waiting until 300 pm on thursday to release all your tickets if you work for a large org theyre working on thousands of tickets each week so you want to make sure that all that code is being released to the website of course the critical component here is that theyre checking for bugs before it goes to your production environment so some questions you might want to ask yourself does your organization have this if you work a large tech company inhouse the answer is likely yes um and does your company have automated test not for seo unless you configured them yourself and are working on maintaining them uh when we started working with our qe team they were like oh we should check canonical tag shouldnt we yeah yeah you should uh so how do you configure it like i just mentioned we had to work with our qa and qe team on this and there are some vendors like deep crawl who have special tools for this but i would recommend checking with your own teams first because these tools are limited to the tests that theyll like that they can run they cost money it takes time to get them integrated in your systems and if you work for a large company you know how long procurement takes so i worked with the qe team and what we did is we outlined all kinds of test that we wanted to set up we listed out all our web surfaces and example urls that was pretty easy because we just took our keyword mapping information we checked uh we made a list of all the critical html elements that we wanted to check for errors and then we talked about um other special things by page type and then finally regional tests are very very important and that really was not something that qe had set up initially so we added a lot of regionalized tests in there too so were checking from houston michigan from uh la from new york city all the markets that really matter for uh cannabis and we use playright for our qe test at weed maps and so this is where we set this up we met weekly with our qe engineers on configuring these and uh i actually staffed for this so i have a fulltime tech seo on my team he was responsible for creating these initial tests um fantastic and then maintaining them so um these are living documents theyre checking code on the site and so so if you go and update your title tag across a template you need to make sure your test remembers that or else obviously its going to flag an error so that thats one thing its stopping bad code from making it to the website very good what this doesnt do is keep engineers from spending time building bad code that wont work for googlebot so we started working with our product development process to get more buyin so uh typically the business process is kind of look something like this theres a business requirements development phase where you have to get approvals to make sure that the project youre proposing meets business goals if that works you move into the product requirement development phase where you actually outline everything that you need for that project once that happens design and engineering happens and then finally you go to market so what areas does seo need to be involved in i would say at least these three and in other cases you may be providing data for the business requirements development section so our prd phase was a hot mess it was super vague every pm was making different templates for it uh they werent even outlining like which urls were being affected and so we would get to the go to market phase and id be like whoa whoa whoa you just introduced 50000 new parameters we cant do that uh and so it would cause thrash at the end of projects uh and it was also a problem for other teams too le goal uh revenue theyd be like hey you didnt ask us about this feature this is not going to work for how we make money so we totally overdid the uh prd requirements phas so theres a template it has all relevant information for stakeholders including things like this google bot user story and acceptance criteria so this is a part of every single one of our web based projects it just says hey unless the project specifically tells you to change these things do not touch them uh and you notice facets and filters is there because thats a thats a big one for my company uh so i would highly encourage you to create some sort of item like this so we have a google doc that we iframe in into confluence where our prds live and then finally project specific requirements so if you need a content block if you need headers specific to the new page we also add that in here so we get very very specific up front so so that engineers and designers know what theyre building then we work with them throughout that phase or through all the phases to make sure that the requirements are being met so were not wasting time and then finally at go to market um were asking does the solution meet those product requirements and also did you go outside the product requirements so uh recently california changed laws uh disposable vape vape pens now have to be called allinone or something different because people people were throwing these batteries in the garbage and youre not supposed to do that so they had to they had a whole lawsuit about it so we had to change our language on the website on certain pages but they overstepped a little bit by accident and did it on all our pages and then what do you know we arent ranking for disposable vape pins anymore so thats also a critical step make sure it doesnt overstep the bounds of the project requirements all right so weve done two critical things stop bad code from going to the website and um freed up engineering time on like these projects for our whole org and now i need some water all right sweet but theres a whole another class of tickets that also cost tech de for our org and these are things that are not part of these larger business initiatives things like software updates legal compliance small projects and all kinds of bug fixes so how do we ensure that those those dont also cause tech debt um these were a huge problem for us because again a lot of these go back to regions and how regions interact with sales all kinds of complex things and so theyre like oh this is just a little tech change and its like well actually now

        "raw_text": "e e e e e e e [Applause] okay thank you for having me Mike that was a great introduction maybe a little bit generous um so I'm going to be talking today about some specifics so over the last two or three years I've been I'd say obsessed with AI and its applications in content marketing SEO and PR so hopefully by the end of this presentation you guys come away with some actionable and hopefully really useful ideas about how you could apply generative AI to automate some or eventually all of your processes so Mike Mike already covered a lot of this but I'm the founder of fractal we do data journalism style campaigns um and we earn Links at scale through that sort of methodology so it's data journalism and then pitching High touch content to Major Publishers and over that time I've overseen maybe 5,000 plus content marketing campaigns that have all earned press and we leverage large language models extensively in many workflows um but always with the human in the loop and that's the most most important thing because these models obviously can confabulate and make things up and that's an essential point for anyone that's going to be doing this sort of automation um and then as I said I've been doing this sort of thing since 2018 and talking about it as well so I did a Blog an AI generated blog in 2018 using one of the first performance large language models um from Allen AI to create a fake blog called this marketing blog does not exist and so I've been aware and I I think a lot of you have also been aware of the disruptive nature of large language models in generative Ai and now it's even more obvious than I think it was back in 2018 but it's coming and it's transforming everything and this industry is among the first that will be transformed so today I'm I'm going to talk about ai's role in marketing uh from a from pattern matching to reasoning so these models have grown and improved a lot over the last year two years um AI agents as autonomous team members a Content paradigm shift so evolving Beyond keywords to intent and context and then how do you effectively work with AI and navigate the balance between human and AI collaboration letting the AI do too much or not allow it to do enough and then some actionable automation strategies AI driven content and SEO real world examples and then some thoughts on the future of marketing and some things that I wanted to share that I think are relevant that are not super welln but are things that you maybe should hear so if we look at the growth of large language models and their adoption gpt3 had 100 million users in roughly two months which is the fastest growth of any product ever as far as I'm aware except for maybe threads beat it after that um so far actually this is a as of last year but generative AI has generated almost a trillion words so it's probably somewhere between one and two trillion words um I think it's about 100 million a day that GPT that Sam mman said GPT was generating a day um and in one to two years I I think it's pretty clear the majority of content on the web will be AI generated I think the figure years already around like 30% so if you're wondering these these videos were created with king. which is a new generative video model if you've not checked it out it's amazing it's nearly as good as Sora which has not been released so when it comes to getting ahead the way that I like to think about this is that the future is really about the commoditization of content and so the question you should always be asking yourself when you're working with large language models is am I creating something that other people could have created just as easily with a prompt in response from GPT and if that's the case then you're not doing enough so is this the other way I like to think about it is am I creating something that's actually Information Gain so it's presenting something entirely new or relevant or is it just recapitulation of existing information summarizing and so on the first is what you want and then the big question in my mind is what is the endgame of generative AI and marketing in general and in my opinion I think it's near zero cost content creation and maybe that's not for five or 10 years but it is coming so let's look back maybe five years limited poor quality expert development by humans almost nobody was using generative AI it had very narrow applications things like this marketing blog does not exist the the Articles were really kind of crappy um two years ago basic automation large language models getting better could do some basic things but still required human oversight um The Challenge there was integration and that's a lot of what I'm going to be talking about here um the the impact of the first one was obviously minimal the second Niche efficiencies um and then a year ago or so we started seeing multitask agents which are large language models put into Frameworks that allow them to do more than just prompt in response um with that you can do things like pipeline management scaling and process Automation and then today where we're entering sort of a new age of AI with models like uh 10 from from open AI that are actually incredible reasoners if you haven't played with that model yet I would um so they can now do complex reasoning the human role is really more about guidance and instruction or it's becoming more of that and then the key challenges are autonomy versus control so how much does the human participate how much does the AI participate how much ises the human managing that process and uh so the impact there is knowledge work shift so this is transformation across knowledge work Industries oops and then five years ahead and this is you know verging on speculation but autonomous AI teams strategic Direction provided by the human um the challenges are governance and adaptation and Industry disruption so maybe that sounds a little hyperbolic or crazy but here are some of the reasons why I think that's true so these are the model progressions on different um Benchmark tests for different language models so GPT 4 and then o1 and then a human on the right here so the right is PhD science questions competition code and competition math and so like as you can see like these models are reaching parity with humans across almost every domain at this point and then this one too so if you guys have not read this is situational awareness by Leopold Ashen Brunner who's a an open AI employee he doesn't work there anymore I'm not exactly sure what happened but he decided to write this incredibly in-depth uh PDF that goes really into depth around exactly why he thinks that the scaling of AI is happening as it is and what he thinks is going to happen the next 5 10 years so this is projections essentially of the orders of magnitude changes from essentially 2018 where we had gpt2 was like a preschooler to 2028 where perhaps we're going to have what I said in the last slide like automated researchers Engineers this should also scare you so this is another sort of metric of the orders of magnitude improvements that we've seen so Chad gbt few minutes numbers of tokens a couple hundred whatever your task is it can do that sort of thing uh now with 01 it's probably we're probably up to the second level so you can do you know thousands of tokens up to 200,000 tokens at a time that whatever task you're trying to do that you might be able to accomplish a half an hour of work with that we're quickly moving to a place where these llms from a single prompt and response could do the equivalent of multiple weeks or multiple months worth of work of one so this is uh the ROI timeline for generative AI use cases this is a survey that Google put out around generative Ai and it's it's just um sort of a snapshot of of the industry in terms of how people think this will be impacting them in the next few years and although I think there are people who are adopting it now you can see it's you know it's pretty small in the sales and marketing it's 33% seeing Roi now that will increase I think to 100% in the next 3 to 5 years and then these are some of the ways that business plan to use generative AI to uh automate and operationalize their businesses so a big question for me is is dead internet Theory coming true and if it is what do we do about it so if you haven't heard of d Internet Theory it's basically the idea that with generative AI models and their capabilities of being able to create such volumes of content so quickly at scale that eventually they'll inundate and overwhelm human content to the extent that it's not really viable to be searched or used anymore so we're already seeing stuff like that happen with a Google image search for baby peacock and see all the red ones are generative AI images and if you actually analyze them versus a baby peacock you'd see there's a lot of mistakes and then bot traffic obviously is also increasing substantially this was last year um the reason for this is because generative models can be Bots right they can analyze information they can assume personalities they can converse with people and convince them that they're actual humans they can pass a Turing test essentially in text over you know relatively small periods so if if dead internet theory is true what does that mean for marketing an SEO so first of all decreased organic traffic I think a lot of you already see that in some some cases uh because large language models offer direct answers reducing clicks to sites so this is true of you know the changes that Google is making but it's also true of people just instead of doing a Google search they use chat GPT or another generative AI to answer a question uh selective clickthrough so I think what you're going to to get ultimately is is less traffic but the traffic that you do get from large language models will be um hyper relevant and very interested different verticals are obviously impacted differently those relying on things that generative AI is good at creating are going to be impacted first and then sadly even less data transparency for marketers these models are essentially black boxes and you can you can extract some data from them but not a lot and then indexes I in my opinion still matter and will matter into the into the future we're always going to need some organization of humans uh content and some way to filter it and search it but the large language models will be using those indexes instead and then um data driven standards so I think content backed by data becomes a norm because these large language models enable essentially data journalism much much more easily than was ever possible before so I think the standards of what information game content or content worth ranking is content that will be data driven and presenting entirely new information and then this is an across theboard thing uh I think ultimately because these large language models can assume personalities and become Bots and that can be scaled it's going to necessitate some level of verifiable identity um and perhaps the growth of closed Gardens over open I think anonymity or pseudo anonymity is probably not something that will be viable and as I said earlier is a perfectly efficient market the end state of air plus marketing I I think that's the goal of of this technology it's not going to the next one oh there we go okay um so this is this is how I like to think about working with LGE language models and I actually had GPT help me code this visualization and it's a visualization um essentially of navigating a latent space so GPT is a this huge model trillion parameters I think it exists all of its knowledge exists in this multi-dimensional space that you are navigating as you're asking it questions and it's answering those questions and as you accumulated conversation you're moving it through that latent space to a particular spot and some of those spots in that latent space are really amazing right they're perfectly Tor to your question or your need others are not they're irrelevant you you know you sense down the wrong path it's not a good result and that's why you see such variable quality of of outcomes from people who are using Ai and so yeah you can sort of think of it as this is a conversation each of those dots is a is a turn in the conversation and you're moving towards a specific location in the Laten space this is a game called infinite Pizza which I sort of thought was similar in its idea so just talking a little bit more about how you can think about and get more out of large language models um improved reasoning with agentic prompting so one thing that I've been doing a lot lately is is this sort of thing I say in iate two agents competing to find the real answer and poke holes in each other's answers until they agree which they are loath to do each agent has unique skills and perspectives and thinks about the problem from a different vantage point and then I give it personalities I so if I'm coding Alan Turing as a top- down agent and Donald nth is a bottom up agent so giving them personality names like this like you are injecting some additional context and the responses will be somewhat more tored to whatever the AI assumes these people would have said and then both agents I say have the ability to think counterfactually step by step thinking from first principles thinking laterally so giving it all of these tools to on how it should think and then having two agents that are competing against each other and checking each other and because because we have such large uh context Windows now this actually starts to work really well and what you'll get when you do this is uh much longer responses where you have one agent giving an answer the second agent evaluating or critiquing that answer and then going back and forth until they've essentially agreed so as I mentioned the 200,000 token context window is something that you really need to be aware of when you're using these large language models and depending on what you're using it for I mean if you're using it just for writing then you might never get to 200,000 tokens but if you're doing coding it can get pretty easy to get there um this is called needle and a haast stock and this is a visualization of a test that's done on on all large language models now and it's it's a recall test so it's examining out of how many tokens that are being generated how accurate are those tokens so this was for GPT 4 and I think 40 is much better than this and anthropic is better than this as well um but through like 75,000 characters you'll see this recall has essentially no errors once you get past that then you start to get issues and errors so keeping this in mind it's important for you to always manage your context so if you're having a conversation with an AI it's helping you with a problem if you get towards you know above depends on the model right but above 100,000 tokens you should probably go back into your conversation delete irrelevant sections of it and then start back from there so the other part is uh critiquing your last answer in depth I almost every time I have it do this and a lot of times you'll notice it catches things provide counterfactuals and edge cases for programming this is incredibly useful I and then this one I've actually been doing recently use checklist extensively to plan so what I've noticed is it especially when you're working with larger context Windows it it can uh forget things so forcing it to use checklists forces it to remember everything because it's essentially writing down what it needs to do first and then then doing it and then broad to narrow so leveraging ai's information synthesis scale 200,000 tokens um I think there are some other models that go up to a million this is where the value really is extracting and synthesizing huge amounts of information and then leveraging highdensity information context so with only 200,000 tokens you want the densest information possible so use shorthand use tables use whatever formats you can to to have the same amount of information in a smaller context so now I'm going to go into um specifics around Advanced pipelines that I've built and my brother Dan has built for internal use cases at fractal but a lot of these are going to be things that we share with the community as well and I'm also going to give you guys 25 Google collab uh like Python scripts essentially that do a lot of the things I'm going to be describing here that you can play with yourself and update and change yourself so this is mentioned a little bit in the previous talk but I think it's important to think about one input many outputs so this was a script I wrote that takes a a YouTube url scrapes the YouTube url um uses whisper API from open AI to transcribe it and then turns it into a tweet thread a long form article and a summary of that article so another another project I worked on was creating long form content um from source of Truth information so this particular one the way that it works is it uh uses a Google Places API and it searches whatever location keyword so in this case itha New York it goes to the location API pulls as much information about that location as possible sends all that location information like the businesses and the events and you know the the hiking and whatever else and then GPT analyzes all that and um creates a long form piece of content from it and then I also added some additional features that extract relevant images and insert those those so you can imagine creating these more complex pipelines that do more and more advanced things so the most powerful thing in my mind is uh combining a source of Truth so like a search index being able to connect to your AI to search um and then having it iterate over and over again so this is a this is another example of long form article generation with semantic SEO understanding and see if it so the way that this works is it takes a keyword it uses Sur API or data for SEO or one of the other SEO data tools scrapes all of that information and then does clustering on it so pulls out entities clusters those entities using sentence Transformer and then does visualizations of those uh at the bottom so okay so this next one is uh another little mini web app automation that we wrote that starts with an initial list of keywords and then uses those keywords to generate uh 200 longt keyword suggestions and then uh it selects the suggestions with the highest search volumes and then finds related keywords to expand the list and so this sort of process you can as I was saying before huge amount of information in filtering it with the large language model yielding something very interesting so in this case it's uh longtail Hidden Gem keywords that have low cost per click High relevance according to the llm so keeping going with this combining sources of Truth apis large language models and iterative pipeline outputs so the script is uh something that you give it a URL it scrapes the URL and then takes all of that information about the URL and sends it to like five or six different on-site um SEO apis um apis around other data around the website like who is and DNS and other things it also takes screenshots of the entire page which you'll see at the bottom um and then uses gpt's new video or image analysis model uh 40 mini to understand the page and give it like uiux recommendations based on that so I mean this sort of thing took me like a day to write with gpt's help and it's essentially like one input a you know a decent SEO report output uh another really valuable thing that you can do is creating um retrieval augmented generation systems for either your internal teams or external projects so in this case we we took the Google leak and put it into a rag Pipeline and the way that this works is when you ask a question uh a search is done of the Corpus using embeddings and then the the closest embeddings the ones that are most related to your question are pulled out given to the large language model and the large language model answers the questions based on that source of Truth information so with this sort of thing you get much much less confabulation in fact very rare so you can also do multimedia type things so this is a this is an app that basically you give it a a search term it goes out and it scrapes Tik Tok using appify which is a great tool for scraping if you guys have like weird sites that are hard to scrape um so scrapes Tik Tok gets the transcripts using the whisper API um sends frame images to GPT 40 um image an image and video analysis provides output on exactly what's happening those videos and what the transcript says and then does some sort of analysis on it so in this case I said asso iological researcher so another another idea Reddit posts uh the hardest thing I think for succeeding on Reddit is finding the rate subreddits and then having the right title for that subreddit if you're not a member of that particular Community you're probably going to get it wrong but GPT knows about every single one of those communities so you can give it an article as an input and then it will go out use the uh Pro API which is Reddit scraping API um may or may not work anymore uh and pulls out all of the relevant information and then makes suggestions around which subreddits would be most appropriate and what the title should be for each of those subreddits oops so so another thing you can obviously do is uh in this case automatic frequently ask questions so the way that this works is you give it a keyword and then it goes out and it scrapes Google for um like the autor response stuff uh also asked a few other a few other keyword related keyword expansion things takes all of them um generates a ton of questions about all of those keywords and then answers those and then organizes it in a list so this iterative process of connecting to an external source of Truth having the AI model analyze it then do something else then do something else toward an output and then this is just one that I wanted to mention to you guys because I think it's very relevant to SEO what happens when the majority of people are using large language models for for getting their answers um you still need to know what your visibility is in those large language models and as I said in the beginning it's a complete Black Box so this is a way to sort of gain insight into it and what we did here was uh compiled the sources essentially the training data sources that were used for GPT and a few other models and so this allows you to search that it's not really an AI enable thing beyond that you know this is this is all AI related data um but it allows you to to essentially find those sorts of Interest insights so this is another project and this is a lot of these are go uh Google collabs that you guys will be able to use or play with on your own um this is essentially creating semantically complete site Maps so what this one does a um it does entity and relationship generation and then it takes Advanced metrics so it computes page Rank and centrality and community detection and then creates these essentially data maps of connections and edges between them so you can you can really very easily using large language models create knowledge graphs which can be used in lots of different ways so automatic cluster evaluations as well which I think was talked about a little bit in the last talk uh very useful for competitive analysis keyword research Trend and social media research and then data science um in this case the way that we did clustering was scrape collate Sur results keywords or content and then get the embeddings so open AI has embeddings they used to be really expensive um hugging face has all the free models that you can use they're pretty on par when you're doing embeddings at least at least as far as it has been made the last few months it might changed and then the amazing thing is you can do clustering with these there's lots of different clustering Al algorithms that you can use but the special thing is that you can then use the large language models to label the Clusters so before when you were doing any sort of clustering You' get clusters and the things in those clusters would be related to each other but you had to say what that cluster was about in this case you can use large language models to identify and label the Clusters which which can turn a project that would have taken hundreds of hours for a human into something that takes few minutes other things that you can do so iterative content creation where you're generating like say you're generating article ideas or keyword ideas start with doing something like creating a Persona and then generating ideas uh inferring the personas based on the keyword that serves metadata um their demographics their psychographics their affinities their purchase intents whatever else because these large language models have an understanding similar to humans because they have all of human knowledge in them or almost um they can do these sorts of things fill out these huge data sets that enhance your ability to do your your work as an SEO another one automatic Trend analysis um so this scrapes posts on Reddit by keyword sorts by top and then infers the primary topics in hierarchy as emotional activators entities whatever else you want that LM can do uh so this is an example really of of data journalism and why I think a lot of content is going to transition to this sort of thing I did this project in like maybe 3 hours and what I did is I compiled all of the Trump incidences there were over 300 of them but I did this using a large language model so like I could have gone coming through you know news stories and doing hundreds of searches to try and find every single one maybe there were a few places that had already tried to aggregate it but it would be very difficult to do to compile this amount of information at once but with a large language model you can do that so iteratively working with the the model to to find you know list all of the Trump incidences over the last whatever 20 years and then take that and ask it to list more that are unique that weren't in the first list and keep doing that over and over again until you get a very large list and then you can programmatically do fact checking on it so this sort of thing applies to anything right like you could use a generative model to create a large data set that then can be visualized in an interesting way that becomes useful to people and these things were you know we had ideas like this at fractal a lot but we never really did them because they would take hundreds of hours to compile that information so it was previously too difficult for one human to grow alt together and it's a really entirely new Avenue for creating unique content uh web crawling with content analysis and anchor text recommendations um just another use case I'm going to go quickly through these because I want to get to theorder sort of wrapping up you could do understanding brand visibility um in an AI first search environment so this is again sort of like a llm SEO sort of sort of thing where um you take I took a keyword and then I iter ly search or sorry I use um I use an llm to create lots of different related keywords and then each of those related keywords I do searches in the llm and scrape the responses from the llm so for instance like asking content marketing or content marketing agencies GPT is going to give me a list of agencies right I could keep doing that over and over and over again in lots of different ways compile all that data and then aggregate it to understand which brands are mentioned the most and then some technical sea things you can give it raw HTML and get schema improvements and things like that in this video I'm going to be showing you canvas which is a new interface within chat GPT for both writing as well as coding project the way Canvas Works is it will open up a separate window and it will allow you to collab okay so things that I think should be on your radar um agentic Frameworks so all of these things that I've been talking about today are in some sense agentic Frameworks which are essentially using large language models sort of having them exist in pieces that work together uh there are lots of different agentic Frameworks emerging autogen crew AI are two that I've used um and found the most useful there are lots of others some of them are really like opaque and difficult to use uh the open ey realtime voice API um if you guys have seen the automatic podcast creator that they released which is amazing and one of those ways that you can extend written content or video content into another format um but this real-time voice API is essentially allowing you all of that functionality that you saw in that podcast generator but through an API so you can create your own experiences with it or your own content creation pipelines with it um and it also they've Alo partnered with uh Agora and another company that I forget the name of which are companies that help like um they have apis that help abstract a lot of the voice handling like the live voice data back and forth which makes it a lot easier than having to do that part yourself which is very difficult cling and text to video AIS apis like the first image in the beginning are coming along you know I think it's not that many years from now we'll have you know 15year olds making Blockbuster level movies with these sorts of text to video apis or AIS uh dead internet of image results is already happening obviously I talked about that earlier um improving tooling and userfriendly agentic tools something you need to be doing uh 01 the latest model from open AI it's I think it's important for you to to use it and understand how this technology is different because it's being optim optimized on its reasoning capabilities in a way that the previous models are not larger and larger context Windows the question here for me is what is the upper limit of this uh is it there are some papers now that show that it might be possible to have infinite context windows and when that's the case like maybe we don't need a search index anymore uh soono udio if you guys haven't played with these they create very high quality music from single prompt in any style and then open source AIS are catching up so Facebook has been leading the way in this uh their llama models but there are many others and people are expanding and iterating on those so they're worth trying because obviously they're they're free aside from the compute um and they are getting to the point where they're at like gp4 level and then domain specific languages are I haven't gotten too much into this yet but I think they are part of the future of helping AIS to really reason well and then some AI breakthroughs that I wanted to mention on the next page yeah sorry um you guys you guys can click on these when I share the deck but yeah I mean so video generation that's the paper that like clling and these other video Generations are based on essentially music generation diffuse role is the is the paper and the the technology Dolly obviously Alpha fold um reinforcement learning for scalable multi-agents so this is this is things like GPT 40 um liquid neural networks which are crazy and too complex to talk about here but they are a key for autonomous systems um new elements or additional elements to prompting so and using mixt of experts so having lots of different responses from AIS and and using them together to come to a better conclusion um multi-token prediction getting the AI to do more predictive uh inference with the same tokens um probabilistic relational models which I guess are important for finance and healthare I don't know too much about those uh uh binary Network which will enable or binary xn or net networks which um will enable mobile and Edge data so one of the big blockers to I think adoption of these AI Technologies is that the really performant ones exist behind apis so you can't build really great apps that allow you to interact with them with your phone in real time but once once we get to the point where we can have these large language models that are super performant that operate on the edge on your phones and other devices then uh I think we're going to start seeing a massive Improvement in adoption and then these are the 25 automation scripts but on LinkedIn I release these I haven't been doing it recently because I've been working on a lot of these other things but if you want to play with these they're on my GitHub or you can click them [Music] here welcome our Ro overlords that says I welcome our robot overlords you know just in case",
        "cleaned_text": "e e e e e e e applause okay thank you for having me mike that was a great introduction maybe a little bit generous um so im going to be talking today about some specifics so over the last two or three years ive been id say obsessed with ai and its applications in content marketing seo and pr so hopefully by the end of this presentation you guys come away with some actionable and hopefully really useful ideas about how you could apply generative ai to automate some or eventually all of your processes so mike mike already covered a lot of this but im the founder of fractal we do data journalism style campaigns um and we earn links at scale through that sort of methodology so its data journalism and then pitching high touch content to major publishers and over that time ive overseen maybe 5000 plus content marketing campaigns that have all earned press and we leverage large language models extensively in many workflows um but always with the human in the loop and thats the most most important thing because these models obviously can confabulate and make things up and thats an essential point for anyone thats going to be doing this sort of automation um and then as i said ive been doing this sort of thing since 2018 and talking about it as well so i did a blog an ai generated blog in 2018 using one of the first performance large language models um from allen ai to create a fake blog called this marketing blog does not exist and so ive been aware and i i think a lot of you have also been aware of the disruptive nature of large language models in generative ai and now its even more obvious than i think it was back in 2018 but its coming and its transforming everything and this industry is among the first that will be transformed so today im im going to talk about ais role in marketing uh from a from pattern matching to reasoning so these models have grown and improved a lot over the last year two years um ai agents as autonomous team members a content paradigm shift so evolving beyond keywords to intent and context and then how do you effectively work with ai and navigate the balance between human and ai collaboration letting the ai do too much or not allow it to do enough and then some actionable automation strategies ai driven content and seo real world examples and then some thoughts on the future of marketing and some things that i wanted to share that i think are relevant that are not super welln but are things that you maybe should hear so if we look at the growth of large language models and their adoption gpt3 had 100 million users in roughly two months which is the fastest growth of any product ever as far as im aware except for maybe threads beat it after that um so far actually this is a as of last year but generative ai has generated almost a trillion words so its probably somewhere between one and two trillion words um i think its about 100 million a day that gpt that sam mman said gpt was generating a day um and in one to two years i i think its pretty clear the majority of content on the web will be ai generated i think the figure years already around like 30 so if youre wondering these these videos were created with king which is a new generative video model if youve not checked it out its amazing its nearly as good as sora which has not been released so when it comes to getting ahead the way that i like to think about this is that the future is really about the commoditization of content and so the question you should always be asking yourself when youre working with large language models is am i creating something that other people could have created just as easily with a prompt in response from gpt and if thats the case then youre not doing enough so is this the other way i like to think about it is am i creating something thats actually information gain so its presenting something entirely new or relevant or is it just recapitulation of existing information summarizing and so on the first is what you want and then the big question in my mind is what is the endgame of generative ai and marketing in general and in my opinion i think its near zero cost content creation and maybe thats not for five or 10 years but it is coming so lets look back maybe five years limited poor quality expert development by humans almost nobody was using generative ai it had very narrow applications things like this marketing blog does not exist the the articles were really kind of crappy um two years ago basic automation large language models getting better could do some basic things but still required human oversight um the challenge there was integration and thats a lot of what im going to be talking about here um the the impact of the first one was obviously minimal the second niche efficiencies um and then a year ago or so we started seeing multitask agents which are large language models put into frameworks that allow them to do more than just prompt in response um with that you can do things like pipeline management scaling and process automation and then today where were entering sort of a new age of ai with models like uh 10 from from open ai that are actually incredible reasoners if you havent played with that model yet i would um so they can now do complex reasoning the human role is really more about guidance and instruction or its becoming more of that and then the key challenges are autonomy versus control so how much does the human participate how much does the ai participate how much ises the human managing that process and uh so the impact there is knowledge work shift so this is transformation across knowledge work industries oops and then five years ahead and this is you know verging on speculation but autonomous ai teams strategic direction provided by the human um the challenges are governance and adaptation and industry disruption so maybe that sounds a little hyperbolic or crazy but here are some of the reasons why i think thats true so these are the model progressions on different um benchmark tests for different language models so gpt 4 and then o1 and then a human on the right here so the right is phd science questions competition code and competition math and so like as you can see like these models are reaching parity with humans across almost every domain at this point and then this one too so if you guys have not read this is situational awareness by leopold ashen brunner whos a an open ai employee he doesnt work there anymore im not exactly sure what happened but he decided to write this incredibly indepth uh pdf that goes really into depth around exactly why he thinks that the scaling of ai is happening as it is and what he thinks is going to happen the next 5 10 years so this is projections essentially of the orders of magnitude changes from essentially 2018 where we had gpt2 was like a preschooler to 2028 where perhaps were going to have what i said in the last slide like automated researchers engineers this should also scare you so this is another sort of metric of the orders of magnitude improvements that weve seen so chad gbt few minutes numbers of tokens a couple hundred whatever your task is it can do that sort of thing uh now with 01 its probably were probably up to the second level so you can do you know thousands of tokens up to 200000 tokens at a time that whatever task youre trying to do that you might be able to accomplish a half an hour of work with that were quickly moving to a place where these llms from a single prompt and response could do the equivalent of multiple weeks or multiple months worth of work of one so this is uh the roi timeline for generative ai use cases this is a survey that google put out around generative ai and its its just um sort of a snapshot of of the industry in terms of how people think this will be impacting them in the next few years and although i think there are people who are adopting it now you can see its you know its pretty small in the sales and marketing its 33 seeing roi now that will increase i think to 100 in the next 3 to 5 years and then these are some of the ways that business plan to use generative ai to uh automate and operationalize their businesses so a big question for me is is dead internet theory coming true and if it is what do we do about it so if you havent heard of d internet theory its basically the idea that with generative ai models and their capabilities of being able to create such volumes of content so quickly at scale that eventually theyll inundate and overwhelm human content to the extent that its not really viable to be searched or used anymore so were already seeing stuff like that happen with a google image search for baby peacock and see all the red ones are generative ai images and if you actually analyze them versus a baby peacock youd see theres a lot of mistakes and then bot traffic obviously is also increasing substantially this was last year um the reason for this is because generative models can be bots right they can analyze information they can assume personalities they can converse with people and convince them that theyre actual humans they can pass a turing test essentially in text over you know relatively small periods so if if dead internet theory is true what does that mean for marketing an seo so first of all decreased organic traffic i think a lot of you already see that in some some cases uh because large language models offer direct answers reducing clicks to sites so this is true of you know the changes that google is making but its also true of people just instead of doing a google search they use chat gpt or another generative ai to answer a question uh selective clickthrough so i think what youre going to to get ultimately is is less traffic but the traffic that you do get from large language models will be um hyper relevant and very interested different verticals are obviously impacted differently those relying on things that generative ai is good at creating are going to be impacted first and then sadly even less data transparency for marketers these models are essentially black boxes and you can you can extract some data from them but not a lot and then indexes i in my opinion still matter and will matter into the into the future were always going to need some organization of humans uh content and some way to filter it and search it but the large language models will be using those indexes instead and then um data driven standards so i think content backed by data becomes a norm because these large language models enable essentially data journalism much much more easily than was ever possible before so i think the standards of what information game content or content worth ranking is content that will be data driven and presenting entirely new information and then this is an across theboard thing uh i think ultimately because these large language models can assume personalities and become bots and that can be scaled its going to necessitate some level of verifiable identity um and perhaps the growth of closed gardens over open i think anonymity or pseudo anonymity is probably not something that will be viable and as i said earlier is a perfectly efficient market the end state of air plus marketing i i think thats the goal of of this technology its not going to the next one oh there we go okay um so this is this is how i like to think about working with lge language models and i actually had gpt help me code this visualization and its a visualization um essentially of navigating a latent space so gpt is a this huge model trillion parameters i think it exists all of its knowledge exists in this multidimensional space that you are navigating as youre asking it questions and its answering those questions and as you accumulated conversation youre moving it through that latent space to a particular spot and some of those spots in that latent space are really amazing right theyre perfectly tor to your question or your need others are not theyre irrelevant you you know you sense down the wrong path its not a good result and thats why you see such variable quality of of outcomes from people who are using ai and so yeah you can sort of think of it as this is a conversation each of those dots is a is a turn in the conversation and youre moving towards a specific location in the laten space this is a game called infinite pizza which i sort of thought was similar in its idea so just talking a little bit more about how you can think about and get more out of large language models um improved reasoning with agentic prompting so one thing that ive been doing a lot lately is is this sort of thing i say in iate two agents competing to find the real answer and poke holes in each others answers until they agree which they are loath to do each agent has unique skills and perspectives and thinks about the problem from a different vantage point and then i give it personalities i so if im coding alan turing as a top down agent and donald nth is a bottom up agent so giving them personality names like this like you are injecting some additional context and the responses will be somewhat more tored to whatever the ai assumes these people would have said and then both agents i say have the ability to think counterfactually step by step thinking from first principles thinking laterally so giving it all of these tools to on how it should think and then having two agents that are competing against each other and checking each other and because because we have such large uh context windows now this actually starts to work really well and what youll get when you do this is uh much longer responses where you have one agent giving an answer the second agent evaluating or critiquing that answer and then going back and forth until theyve essentially agreed so as i mentioned the 200000 token context window is something that you really need to be aware of when youre using these large language models and depending on what youre using it for i mean if youre using it just for writing then you might never get to 200000 tokens but if youre doing coding it can get pretty easy to get there um this is called needle and a haast stock and this is a visualization of a test thats done on on all large language models now and its its a recall test so its examining out of how many tokens that are being generated how accurate are those tokens so this was for gpt 4 and i think 40 is much better than this and anthropic is better than this as well um but through like 75000 characters youll see this recall has essentially no errors once you get past that then you start to get issues and errors so keeping this in mind its important for you to always manage your context so if youre having a conversation with an ai its helping you with a problem if you get towards you know above depends on the model right but above 100000 tokens you should probably go back into your conversation delete irrelevant sections of it and then start back from there so the other part is uh critiquing your last answer in depth i almost every time i have it do this and a lot of times youll notice it catches things provide counterfactuals and edge cases for programming this is incredibly useful i and then this one ive actually been doing recently use checklist extensively to plan so what ive noticed is it especially when youre working with larger context windows it it can uh forget things so forcing it to use checklists forces it to remember everything because its essentially writing down what it needs to do first and then then doing it and then broad to narrow so leveraging ais information synthesis scale 200000 tokens um i think there are some other models that go up to a million this is where the value really is extracting and synthesizing huge amounts of information and then leveraging highdensity information context so with only 200000 tokens you want the densest information possible so use shorthand use tables use whatever formats you can to to have the same amount of information in a smaller context so now im going to go into um specifics around advanced pipelines that ive built and my brother dan has built for internal use cases at fractal but a lot of these are going to be things that we share with the community as well and im also going to give you guys 25 google collab uh like python scripts essentially that do a lot of the things im going to be describing here that you can play with yourself and update and change yourself so this is mentioned a little bit in the previous talk but i think its important to think about one input many outputs so this was a script i wrote that takes a a youtube url scrapes the youtube url um uses whisper api from open ai to transcribe it and then turns it into a tweet thread a long form article and a summary of that article so another another project i worked on was creating long form content um from source of truth information so this particular one the way that it works is it uh uses a google places api and it searches whatever location keyword so in this case itha new york it goes to the location api pulls as much information about that location as possible sends all that location information like the businesses and the events and you know the the hiking and whatever else and then gpt analyzes all that and um creates a long form piece of content from it and then i also added some additional features that extract relevant images and insert those those so you can imagine creating these more complex pipelines that do more and more advanced things so the most powerful thing in my mind is uh combining a source of truth so like a search index being able to connect to your ai to search um and then having it iterate over and over again so this is a this is another example of long form article generation with semantic seo understanding and see if it so the way that this works is it takes a keyword it uses sur api or data for seo or one of the other seo data tools scrapes all of that information and then does clustering on it so pulls out entities clusters those entities using sentence transformer and then does visualizations of those uh at the bottom so okay so this next one is uh another little mini web app automation that we wrote that starts with an initial list of keywords and then uses those keywords to generate uh 200 longt keyword suggestions and then uh it selects the suggestions with the highest search volumes and then finds related keywords to expand the list and so this sort of process you can as i was saying before huge amount of information in filtering it with the large language model yielding something very interesting so in this case its uh longtail hidden gem keywords that have low cost per click high relevance according to the llm so keeping going with this combining sources of truth apis large language models and iterative pipeline outputs so the script is uh something that you give it a url it scrapes the url and then takes all of that information about the url and sends it to like five or six different onsite um seo apis um apis around other data around the website like who is and dns and other things it also takes screenshots of the entire page which youll see at the bottom um and then uses gpts new video or image analysis model uh 40 mini to understand the page and give it like uiux recommendations based on that so i mean this sort of thing took me like a day to write with gpts help and its essentially like one input a you know a decent seo report output uh another really valuable thing that you can do is creating um retrieval augmented generation systems for either your internal teams or external projects so in this case we we took the google leak and put it into a rag pipeline and the way that this works is when you ask a question uh a search is done of the corpus using embeddings and then the the closest embeddings the ones that are most related to your question are pulled out given to the large language model and the large language model answers the questions based on that source of truth information so with this sort of thing you get much much less confabulation in fact very rare so you can also do multimedia type things so this is a this is an app that basically you give it a a search term it goes out and it scrapes tik tok using appify which is a great tool for scraping if you guys have like weird sites that are hard to scrape um so scrapes tik tok gets the transcripts using the whisper api um sends frame images to gpt 40 um image an image and video analysis provides output on exactly whats happening those videos and what the transcript says and then does some sort of analysis on it so in this case i said asso iological researcher so another another idea reddit posts uh the hardest thing i think for succeeding on reddit is finding the rate subreddits and then having the right title for that subreddit if youre not a member of that particular community youre probably going to get it wrong but gpt knows about every single one of those communities so you can give it an article as an input and then it will go out use the uh pro api which is reddit scraping api um may or may not work anymore uh and pulls out all of the relevant information and then makes suggestions around which subreddits would be most appropriate and what the title should be for each of those subreddits oops so so another thing you can obviously do is uh in this case automatic frequently ask questions so the way that this works is you give it a keyword and then it goes out and it scrapes google for um like the autor response stuff uh also asked a few other a few other keyword related keyword expansion things takes all of them um generates a ton of questions about all of those keywords and then answers those and then organizes it in a list so this iterative process of connecting to an external source of truth having the ai model analyze it then do something else then do something else toward an output and then this is just one that i wanted to mention to you guys because i think its very relevant to seo what happens when the majority of people are using large language models for for getting their answers um you still need to know what your visibility is in those large language models and as i said in the beginning its a complete black box so this is a way to sort of gain insight into it and what we did here was uh compiled the sources essentially the training data sources that were used for gpt and a few other models and so this allows you to search that its not really an ai enable thing beyond that you know this is this is all ai related data um but it allows you to to essentially find those sorts of interest insights so this is another project and this is a lot of these are go uh google collabs that you guys will be able to use or play with on your own um this is essentially creating semantically complete site maps so what this one does a um it does entity and relationship generation and then it takes advanced metrics so it computes page rank and centrality and community detection and then creates these essentially data maps of connections and edges between them so you can you can really very easily using large language models create knowledge graphs which can be used in lots of different ways so automatic cluster evaluations as well which i think was talked about a little bit in the last talk uh very useful for competitive analysis keyword research trend and social media research and then data science um in this case the way that we did clustering was scrape collate sur results keywords or content and then get the embeddings so open ai has embeddings they used to be really expensive um hugging face has all the free models that you can use theyre pretty on par when youre doing embeddings at least at least as far as it has been made the last few months it might changed and then the amazing thing is you can do clustering with these theres lots of different clustering al algorithms that you can use but the special thing is that you can then use the large language models to label the clusters so before when you were doing any sort of clustering you get clusters and the things in those clusters would be related to each other but you had to say what that cluster was about in this case you can use large language models to identify and label the clusters which which can turn a project that would have taken hundreds of hours for a human into something that takes few minutes other things that you can do so iterative content creation where youre generating like say youre generating article ideas or keyword ideas start with doing something like creating a persona and then generating ideas uh inferring the personas based on the keyword that serves metadata um their demographics their psychographics their affinities their purchase intents whatever else because these large language models have an understanding similar to humans because they have all of human knowledge in them or almost um they can do these sorts of things fill out these huge data sets that enhance your ability to do your your work as an seo another one automatic trend analysis um so this scrapes posts on reddit by keyword sorts by top and then infers the primary topics in hierarchy as emotional activators entities whatever else you want that lm can do uh so this is an example really of of data journalism and why i think a lot of content is going to transition to this sort of thing i did this project in like maybe 3 hours and what i did is i compiled all of the trump incidences there were over 300 of them but i did this using a large language model so like i could have gone coming through you know news stories and doing hundreds of searches to try and find every single one maybe there were a few places that had already tried to aggregate it but it would be very difficult to do to compile this amount of information at once but with a large language model you can do that so iteratively working with the the model to to find you know list all of the trump incidences over the last whatever 20 years and then take that and ask it to list more that are unique that werent in the first list and keep doing that over and over again until you get a very large list and then you can programmatically do fact checking on it so this sort of thing applies to anything right like you could use a generative model to create a large data set that then can be visualized in an interesting way that becomes useful to people and these things were you know we had ideas like this at fractal a lot but we never really did them because they would take hundreds of hours to compile that information so it was previously too difficult for one human to grow alt together and its a really entirely new avenue for creating unique content uh web crawling with content analysis and anchor text recommendations um just another use case im going to go quickly through these because i want to get to theorder sort of wrapping up you could do understanding brand visibility um in an ai first search environment so this is again sort of like a llm seo sort of sort of thing where um you take i took a keyword and then i iter ly search or sorry i use um i use an llm to create lots of different related keywords and then each of those related keywords i do searches in the llm and scrape the responses from the llm so for instance like asking content marketing or content marketing agencies gpt is going to give me a list of agencies right i could keep doing that over and over and over again in lots of different ways compile all that data and then aggregate it to understand which brands are mentioned the most and then some technical sea things you can give it raw html and get schema improvements and things like that in this video im going to be showing you canvas which is a new interface within chat gpt for both writing as well as coding project the way canvas works is it will open up a separate window and it will allow you to collab okay so things that i think should be on your radar um agentic frameworks so all of these things that ive been talking about today are in some sense agentic frameworks which are essentially using large language models sort of having them exist in pieces that work together uh there are lots of different agentic frameworks emerging autogen crew ai are two that ive used um and found the most useful there are lots of others some of them are really like opaque and difficult to use uh the open ey realtime voice api um if you guys have seen the automatic podcast creator that they released which is amazing and one of those ways that you can extend written content or video content into another format um but this realtime voice api is essentially allowing you all of that functionality that you saw in that podcast generator but through an api so you can create your own experiences with it or your own content creation pipelines with it um and it also theyve alo partnered with uh agora and another company that i forget the name of which are companies that help like um they have apis that help abstract a lot of the voice handling like the live voice data back and forth which makes it a lot easier than having to do that part yourself which is very difficult cling and text to video ais apis like the first image in the beginning are coming along you know i think its not that many years from now well have you know 15year olds making blockbuster level movies with these sorts of text to video apis or ais uh dead internet of image results is already happening obviously i talked about that earlier um improving tooling and userfriendly agentic tools something you need to be doing uh 01 the latest model from open ai its i think its important for you to to use it and understand how this technology is different because its being optim optimized on its reasoning capabilities in a way that the previous models are not larger and larger context windows the question here for me is what is the upper limit of this uh is it there are some papers now that show that it might be possible to have infinite context windows and when thats the case like maybe we dont need a search index anymore uh soono udio if you guys havent played with these they create very high quality music from single prompt in any style and then open source ais are catching up so facebook has been leading the way in this uh their llama models but there are many others and people are expanding and iterating on those so theyre worth trying because obviously theyre theyre free aside from the compute um and they are getting to the point where theyre at like gp4 level and then domain specific languages are i havent gotten too much into this yet but i think they are part of the future of helping ais to really reason well and then some ai breakthroughs that i wanted to mention on the next page yeah sorry um you guys you guys can click on these when i share the deck but yeah i mean so video generation thats the paper that like clling and these other video generations are based on essentially music generation diffuse role is the is the paper and the the technology dolly obviously alpha fold um reinforcement learning for scalable multiagents so this is this is things like gpt 40 um liquid neural networks which are crazy and too complex to talk about here but they are a key for autonomous systems um new elements or additional elements to prompting so and using mixt of experts so having lots of different responses from ais and and using them together to come to a better conclusion um multitoken prediction getting the ai to do more predictive uh inference with the same tokens um probabilistic relational models which i guess are important for finance and healthare i dont know too much about those uh uh binary network which will enable or binary xn or net networks which um will enable mobile and edge data so one of the big blockers to i think adoption of these ai technologies is that the really performant ones exist behind apis so you cant build really great apps that allow you to interact with them with your phone in real time but once once we get to the point where we can have these large language models that are super performant that operate on the edge on your phones and other devices then uh i think were going to start seeing a massive improvement in adoption and then these are the 25 automation scripts but on linkedin i release these i havent been doing it recently because ive been working on a lot of these other things but if you want to play with these theyre on my github or you can click them music here welcome our ro overlords that says i welcome our robot overlords you know just in case",

        "raw_text": "[Applause] is Paul Shapiro here can you stand upap clap for Paul Shapiro because Paul put on Tech SEO boost several years ago and it was the best conference I've ever been to in my life and you felt like you were walking into a warm family and we tried to do some honor to that here so I really appreciate the initial idea for these types of conferences and all you do for the community Paul [Applause] um so 2024 has been like a really weird year uh I feel like I'm like technically an SEO now even though I'm used to be a technical SEO um we uh have been uh looking at a lot of interesting things that have been going on in uh obviously with llms and Ai and I think everybody else has um Google released the paper I think around the time that was um uh uh the Google IO conference where they talk about this idea of like unlimited context Windows right like a million two million tokens that you can fit in these models and um uh the models can can attend to everything and they actually hide like these like PIN numbers in the context Windows to see how well they retrieve the stuff it's like really fascinating but just the idea that you can fit like 13 books I think Mike talked about like just putting a Bible in there and you know it can read and understand and and transform and you know they summarize like 500,000 uh uh books of like 500,000 words and to test these models out just fascinating um does everybody have like are are everybody here like tracking their uh this stuff in GA right uh is it really interesting to see it from uh to site and like which sites really like are actually getting some uh of the AI traffic and which aren't uh obviously Google's still dominating um obviously everybody's seen the Gartner report where it's likeo is going to be like 50% in a few years and think I don't know maybe it is but we've been thinking about the things that kind of go into producing visibility for clients and not necessarily more of the like practical pieces but like real experience we see the Reddit craze right from the last few years and engagement and trust and expertise a lot of those go to like the eat stuff with Google if you like that but um just thinking about the real world as will Reynolds used to say that you can do that actually drives uh visibility and reverberates your brand online I think is super interesting um this is one piece recently that I thought was really interesting that language models are like just really bougie and like to use the word delve let's delve into this topic a little bit more uh and I think more interesting is that he shows this like jump in like the last two years of like PubMed articles or Publications so you have people doing these Pub PubMed Publications running it through chat gbt right you can look at the word distributions it's it's it's fascinating um and then I'm going like really fast here because we need like stuff to catch up on uh thanks Alita I really appreciate it uh so uh Patrick and I were we talking uh Patrick stocks a few weeks ago and like I'm not very I'm not very bullish on like brand and rank tracking with AI I think there's problems there but I did do a couple of searches where we asked models like every model from uh chat gbt like the top 10 best SEO agencies do y'all agree with this maybe maybody I don't know anybody hear from any of those web effects and night visibility Thrive straight North but I think it's interesting like how consistent they are except for that one thing that just kind of went off maybe that here's another one best AI writing tools it's just I was just struck with how consistent that was over the last couple of years in a bunch of different models which maybe it speaks to the similarity and the Corpus of training data that they're using but um I was wrong uh but I still think I have some points because I think what we're seeing with language models is that there's a lot beginning to be a lot more in between us on the actual model right like you have temperature controls does anybody know what a random seat is any geeky like that uh it's a thing that you a number that you can provide so that there's some determinism in the randomness of of of uh of computers uh and you can change a random seed and you get a different result on each model right um You have rag you have memory now um and obviously anybody that's looked really deeply into keywords know that people really weird when they like search for so uh I don't know I think there's a lot of weirdness there uh I'm just as a plug for an open source project that I think is like really cool called Liber chat um we've had a struggle at our agency because everybody like wants to use like open Ai and cloud and some of these tools and like we don't want them to put like client data in there right so this is a really cool platform because it kind of gives you that ux but you can put in API keys and to a lot of the best models you can give your entire team like the best models right of every platform there's a lot of other cool features to it but you can also do it in a way that you know it's not like premium versions and you know data is going and training future models so I would check that out it's it's pretty pretty cool we're just uh implemented it um so I said I'm not technically a SEO anymore I'm still SEO but I look at like a lot of trends that are going on um uh a few things that like really interesting to me is is anybody looking at CLE AI space at all uh Amazon and Microsoft are doing some like really cool with call AI where they can run like thousands and thousands of ab tests in Cloud using these causal models and figure out whether the blue button is better than the red button on some of these and it's all just probablistic models that they're running and it's uh they're putting a ton of effort into it it's a there's a library called doy uh that uh you can you can play around with they have a really cool e-commerce example for looking at um like root calls analysis um really geeky and cool um obviously generative AI is at the top and like the other piece for me is I think personalization which I think generative Ai and personalization and causal all this stuff is going to mean like in the next few years we have like the most incredible experiences online right all the data that we can use about users and um and uh kind of assimilate that with language models I think it's just incredibly cool um I guess with that said looking at like LinkedIn which is my only social platform now feel like people are talking about a lot of the problems with AI and obviously Everybody's scared of the future of AI with Gartner predictions and whatnot or um they're just like just spamming like AI content right like one of the oldest NP libraries that does like word distributions across the internet like gave that up in the last year they're not updating it because all the distributions of of terms and term frequencies across the internet is is garbage now because you saw the delve argument right and then like I think about my daughter's grandchildren looking up baby peacock and they're going to see this online right it's just it's garbage like right what does a real peacock even look like anymore um but this has to come to a head at some point right um anyway everybody's obviously chasing Ai and it's cool um I think uh this uh kind of was one piece that maybe planted the seed for like a open source project that we worked on that I'm going to show it I promise I'll get to the purpose of this this talk uh but I read this paper where Microsoft was talking about like how good language models are at at creating like rational arguments causal arguments and um with uh call AI and doy one of the features there is like creating these kind of directed graphs of like the things that feed into outcomes right and then the model can take that and kind of uh take away certain of the priors right and see what happens and add it back and can do some probabilities with that but just the fact that language models are able they have that kind of ground truth or they're having that ground Truth where you can say hey uh we have X outcome right and it can kind of backtrack and say well maybe this and this and this and this and kind of provide some of those priors I think is super super interesting um so getting I guess more into the the purpose here uh I work for uh locomotive uh some of our team members are here I really appreciate you guys coming out and supporting this weird conference uh uh but uh we've been building a lot this year um we have a tool we built called empath that I think is the coolest thing ever because it takes it takes all of your events from analytics and just transforms it into sequences and there are like genetic algorithms that you can use or or read about online where it's just sequence analysis right like what are the sequences from this to this to this and what do they mean from a genetic perspective well some of that you can apply over to uh event data right it's just a sequence of events right and you can do different sequence analysis on that and learn different things about path cohorts uh of users and preferences of users and next page analysis and like where people are going uh we also built a tool that takes you can just like write in your products and services and a bunch of ICP information and it just goes out and generates like 10 million keywords and then qualifies them back down and labels them that's the I think that's the coolest thing we've worked on this year right Savannah uh We've uh we're not doing keywords anymore uh I hate keywords like we just take all the keywords and then translate them back to topics so we're looking at 300 topics rather than 300,000 keywords keywords suck uh and then um we're also working on anomaly detection I know Alita was posting some cool about uh for for casting and that's right aligned with anomaly detection but where can we find the like the Neato and the Hast there and millions of URLs and learnings there I think that's super interesting but in preparing for this and I will say that again I think Paul gave me I saw him he's going to have the coolest damn presentation and I like really cannot believe what he is building or built but I was like damn it if Paul's building something I want to build something too uh so so the thing that I thought about is really smart but like can we just like pull a bunch of on a URL and throw it into a big bucket right and then do that every month or every week and then have a a language model do all it kind of crazy stuff with CLE right and compare those two and give us some data right or give us some uh hey here's what happened which I think is cool I was thinking about this little robot that lives in the cloud and like takes care of all my page babies every month uh just kind of Zen right uh but obviously we need to put some pieces together because websites are big uh can we fit all the data and can and have Dependable output well uh like I love CLA Cloud's my like go-to but like Gemini is getting there and Gemini has some like really cool stuff from a data perspective that makes it really helpy helpful uh number one 2 million tokens and kind of a good usage of that context history is really helpful um plus you can specify your mind type output and your structured Json schema here's what I want my schema to be which is like infinitely helpful when you're trying to do deterministic work uh at scale uh yeah that's really important uh and then when I was putting this together I kind of thought about this like Tech Deck that we now get into as seos is we're creating things um you know I don't know if anybody here is how many python developers we are but you load a new application in and then some Library like from two years ago is outdated and now everything breaks right and it does the same thing happen with language models that we have to like pin it to 3.5 right uh which is interesting but uh the next thing is with URLs it's like can we afford this like right can I collect all the data on every URLs every month and then you know uh can we do it at that granularity and I think yes right probably not for New York Times but uh for most like thousand page websites I think we could like look at the before and after URLs for like 20 30 bucks for using uh a language model which is kind of cool uh what if it's not perfect I probably get hate for this but uh I mean models will definitely get better right like let's start playing with some of this stuff now uh but obviously they have like mixture of experts and um they're they're getting infinitely better on this wide range of tasks and I think some things that are still lagging but definitely going in the right direction I would say uh and then I also think they're getting more accurate right we're seeing less hallucinations if I wondered if we like went back and just forced ourselves for a day to go back and start using like Chad gpt3 again if we'd be like oh has changed right we're sitting there was a comedian one time that was talking about like like people getting mad at their cell phone and he's like I don't remember you remember who that is he's like it's communicating huh who was it yeah Louis C he's like it's communicating with like space right and I'm like this the same thing it's like language models are just insanely incredible if you think about it right and you're sitting there arguing with it uh but and another thing is we're going to open source it so if you can change your if you don't like it adjust the prompts do whatever you want to tweak it it's fun uh and then this was the last thing I kind of needed to get over but like we do math and like uh uh and SEO and you know change and you know can they do that and no they're terrible uh and they don't know that going from 7 to 9 is not a great thing from a ranking perspective and the uh just really bad uh but I did figure out that they're good at copy pasting right so they can do like CLE and then they can copy paste and then I can come back and because they structure the output really nicely I can go back and say okay here's the prior here's the current and then we can do those calculations for the model uh and then looking at what contexts we can provide pretty good amount um SCP SC the hell out of page feed insights Rick uh and search engine performance from search console content analysis probably do some Trends which would be really cool and hook it up to nozzle and hook it up to HRS and throw a bunch of stuff in there uh this is all the cool stuff from ga4 which I love the idea of like incorporating like next visits like what happened after people went to this page or how did they get to this page and you can like really think about like how to kind of massage the analysis that you want to throw in these buckets right to get the model to react to I think that's just cool so it's called sep this is like a toy model right uh uh and uh the idea is like an eye in the cloud watching my content uh oh I love like releasing like open- Source little stupid projects uh for people to geek around with so that's if you didn't know that's my thing uh and it's on GitHub you can pull it down you can play around with it I will say that you need a developer um so hopefully you know a developer friend that can help you hook it up uh and then I normally try not to have dependencies that you pay for but like scraping be is like my favorite little thing because it takes away the rendering I don't have to think about like the rendering process I can just give it to scraping B and they'll render it and send it back to me and scraping that one has this code has a really interesting thing because with scraping B we throw in mozilla's readability and mozilla's readability Library uh does a really good job of extracting like the really clean content from the page so there's also a solve there if you go through the code for some potential issues and then mael trap is just free so um but yeah those that's the things you have to set up also made like a really kind of easy structure here um tried to make it extensible so that you could add in easily different extractors for different things uh and then I think this is cool you have like a really easy setup so you get uh your data set up you get your GA set up you get your uh uh search console and then you can just like tell it here's what I want to see right and you can change this right um and then you get these like really cool emails every month right it goes in and essentially crawls all of the URL stores the data pauses till the next period sto uh crawls them again Compares them against the the past and then anything that's in passes some importantance thresholds it'll just email you and say hey this happened right which that's I think what I want right uh like here's a cool thing um we uh that it CAU this page it just went from uh what is that a 16% change like those are the things that I don't want to have to like sit there and dig if it can just kind of pull that out for me and say Hey you know you release this Rel uh change on this page and hey it actually did really good and I can fire that off and say hey the page we optimized last month is doing really good right and it'll kind of prompt for those uh this was cool because we ran this uh for a client that just did a major like Rebrand right and one of the things that it pointed out is like your next Pages after your homepage to contact us like went down significantly with that change right that's important right and it picked it out um because we thought about it and and and put that in there so that's it uh it's called SEO DP there's a link in the presentation uh and then I did this other thing and I don't know if y'all like this or not but I like when I'm coding in Python to have a a Jupiter notebook there cuz I'm like why framing code there and then I'm like well what if I just coded something that would just take everything in that repo and throw it to the two million context window of Google so when I'm asking for code changes it's looking at my entire code base right and it sees the dependencies it sees um my requirements file it sees all that stuff uh I didn't like cursor I know cursor does that but cursor is feels like a they took like VSS code and just duplicated it and tweaked some and I I don't know I it's it's huge right now yeah it is I'm just like I like VSS code I have it set up this does markdown it does like code changes here's what changed you can like tweak the font or the prompts anyway that's it thank you for listening to my geekery [Applause]",
        "cleaned_text": "applause is paul shapiro here can you stand upap clap for paul shapiro because paul put on tech seo boost several years ago and it was the best conference ive ever been to in my life and you felt like you were walking into a warm family and we tried to do some honor to that here so i really appreciate the initial idea for these types of conferences and all you do for the community paul applause um so 2024 has been like a really weird year uh i feel like im like technically an seo now even though im used to be a technical seo um we uh have been uh looking at a lot of interesting things that have been going on in uh obviously with llms and ai and i think everybody else has um google released the paper i think around the time that was um uh uh the google io conference where they talk about this idea of like unlimited context windows right like a million two million tokens that you can fit in these models and um uh the models can can attend to everything and they actually hide like these like pin numbers in the context windows to see how well they retrieve the stuff its like really fascinating but just the idea that you can fit like 13 books i think mike talked about like just putting a bible in there and you know it can read and understand and and transform and you know they summarize like 500000 uh uh books of like 500000 words and to test these models out just fascinating um does everybody have like are are everybody here like tracking their uh this stuff in ga right uh is it really interesting to see it from uh to site and like which sites really like are actually getting some uh of the ai traffic and which arent uh obviously googles still dominating um obviously everybodys seen the gartner report where its likeo is going to be like 50 in a few years and think i dont know maybe it is but weve been thinking about the things that kind of go into producing visibility for clients and not necessarily more of the like practical pieces but like real experience we see the reddit craze right from the last few years and engagement and trust and expertise a lot of those go to like the eat stuff with google if you like that but um just thinking about the real world as will reynolds used to say that you can do that actually drives uh visibility and reverberates your brand online i think is super interesting um this is one piece recently that i thought was really interesting that language models are like just really bougie and like to use the word delve lets delve into this topic a little bit more uh and i think more interesting is that he shows this like jump in like the last two years of like pubmed articles or publications so you have people doing these pub pubmed publications running it through chat gbt right you can look at the word distributions its its its fascinating um and then im going like really fast here because we need like stuff to catch up on uh thanks alita i really appreciate it uh so uh patrick and i were we talking uh patrick stocks a few weeks ago and like im not very im not very bullish on like brand and rank tracking with ai i think theres problems there but i did do a couple of searches where we asked models like every model from uh chat gbt like the top 10 best seo agencies do yall agree with this maybe maybody i dont know anybody hear from any of those web effects and night visibility thrive straight north but i think its interesting like how consistent they are except for that one thing that just kind of went off maybe that heres another one best ai writing tools its just i was just struck with how consistent that was over the last couple of years in a bunch of different models which maybe it speaks to the similarity and the corpus of training data that theyre using but um i was wrong uh but i still think i have some points because i think what were seeing with language models is that theres a lot beginning to be a lot more in between us on the actual model right like you have temperature controls does anybody know what a random seat is any geeky like that uh its a thing that you a number that you can provide so that theres some determinism in the randomness of of of uh of computers uh and you can change a random seed and you get a different result on each model right um you have rag you have memory now um and obviously anybody thats looked really deeply into keywords know that people really weird when they like search for so uh i dont know i think theres a lot of weirdness there uh im just as a plug for an open source project that i think is like really cool called liber chat um weve had a struggle at our agency because everybody like wants to use like open ai and cloud and some of these tools and like we dont want them to put like client data in there right so this is a really cool platform because it kind of gives you that ux but you can put in api keys and to a lot of the best models you can give your entire team like the best models right of every platform theres a lot of other cool features to it but you can also do it in a way that you know its not like premium versions and you know data is going and training future models so i would check that out its its pretty pretty cool were just uh implemented it um so i said im not technically a seo anymore im still seo but i look at like a lot of trends that are going on um uh a few things that like really interesting to me is is anybody looking at cle ai space at all uh amazon and microsoft are doing some like really cool with call ai where they can run like thousands and thousands of ab tests in cloud using these causal models and figure out whether the blue button is better than the red button on some of these and its all just probablistic models that theyre running and its uh theyre putting a ton of effort into it its a theres a library called doy uh that uh you can you can play around with they have a really cool ecommerce example for looking at um like root calls analysis um really geeky and cool um obviously generative ai is at the top and like the other piece for me is i think personalization which i think generative ai and personalization and causal all this stuff is going to mean like in the next few years we have like the most incredible experiences online right all the data that we can use about users and um and uh kind of assimilate that with language models i think its just incredibly cool um i guess with that said looking at like linkedin which is my only social platform now feel like people are talking about a lot of the problems with ai and obviously everybodys scared of the future of ai with gartner predictions and whatnot or um theyre just like just spamming like ai content right like one of the oldest np libraries that does like word distributions across the internet like gave that up in the last year theyre not updating it because all the distributions of of terms and term frequencies across the internet is is garbage now because you saw the delve argument right and then like i think about my daughters grandchildren looking up baby peacock and theyre going to see this online right its just its garbage like right what does a real peacock even look like anymore um but this has to come to a head at some point right um anyway everybodys obviously chasing ai and its cool um i think uh this uh kind of was one piece that maybe planted the seed for like a open source project that we worked on that im going to show it i promise ill get to the purpose of this this talk uh but i read this paper where microsoft was talking about like how good language models are at at creating like rational arguments causal arguments and um with uh call ai and doy one of the features there is like creating these kind of directed graphs of like the things that feed into outcomes right and then the model can take that and kind of uh take away certain of the priors right and see what happens and add it back and can do some probabilities with that but just the fact that language models are able they have that kind of ground truth or theyre having that ground truth where you can say hey uh we have x outcome right and it can kind of backtrack and say well maybe this and this and this and this and kind of provide some of those priors i think is super super interesting um so getting i guess more into the the purpose here uh i work for uh locomotive uh some of our team members are here i really appreciate you guys coming out and supporting this weird conference uh uh but uh weve been building a lot this year um we have a tool we built called empath that i think is the coolest thing ever because it takes it takes all of your events from analytics and just transforms it into sequences and there are like genetic algorithms that you can use or or read about online where its just sequence analysis right like what are the sequences from this to this to this and what do they mean from a genetic perspective well some of that you can apply over to uh event data right its just a sequence of events right and you can do different sequence analysis on that and learn different things about path cohorts uh of users and preferences of users and next page analysis and like where people are going uh we also built a tool that takes you can just like write in your products and services and a bunch of icp information and it just goes out and generates like 10 million keywords and then qualifies them back down and labels them thats the i think thats the coolest thing weve worked on this year right savannah uh weve uh were not doing keywords anymore uh i hate keywords like we just take all the keywords and then translate them back to topics so were looking at 300 topics rather than 300000 keywords keywords suck uh and then um were also working on anomaly detection i know alita was posting some cool about uh for for casting and thats right aligned with anomaly detection but where can we find the like the neato and the hast there and millions of urls and learnings there i think thats super interesting but in preparing for this and i will say that again i think paul gave me i saw him hes going to have the coolest damn presentation and i like really cannot believe what he is building or built but i was like damn it if pauls building something i want to build something too uh so so the thing that i thought about is really smart but like can we just like pull a bunch of on a url and throw it into a big bucket right and then do that every month or every week and then have a a language model do all it kind of crazy stuff with cle right and compare those two and give us some data right or give us some uh hey heres what happened which i think is cool i was thinking about this little robot that lives in the cloud and like takes care of all my page babies every month uh just kind of zen right uh but obviously we need to put some pieces together because websites are big uh can we fit all the data and can and have dependable output well uh like i love cla clouds my like goto but like gemini is getting there and gemini has some like really cool stuff from a data perspective that makes it really helpy helpful uh number one 2 million tokens and kind of a good usage of that context history is really helpful um plus you can specify your mind type output and your structured json schema heres what i want my schema to be which is like infinitely helpful when youre trying to do deterministic work uh at scale uh yeah thats really important uh and then when i was putting this together i kind of thought about this like tech deck that we now get into as seos is were creating things um you know i dont know if anybody here is how many python developers we are but you load a new application in and then some library like from two years ago is outdated and now everything breaks right and it does the same thing happen with language models that we have to like pin it to 35 right uh which is interesting but uh the next thing is with urls its like can we afford this like right can i collect all the data on every urls every month and then you know uh can we do it at that granularity and i think yes right probably not for new york times but uh for most like thousand page websites i think we could like look at the before and after urls for like 20 30 bucks for using uh a language model which is kind of cool uh what if its not perfect i probably get hate for this but uh i mean models will definitely get better right like lets start playing with some of this stuff now uh but obviously they have like mixture of experts and um theyre theyre getting infinitely better on this wide range of tasks and i think some things that are still lagging but definitely going in the right direction i would say uh and then i also think theyre getting more accurate right were seeing less hallucinations if i wondered if we like went back and just forced ourselves for a day to go back and start using like chad gpt3 again if wed be like oh has changed right were sitting there was a comedian one time that was talking about like like people getting mad at their cell phone and hes like i dont remember you remember who that is hes like its communicating huh who was it yeah louis c hes like its communicating with like space right and im like this the same thing its like language models are just insanely incredible if you think about it right and youre sitting there arguing with it uh but and another thing is were going to open source it so if you can change your if you dont like it adjust the prompts do whatever you want to tweak it its fun uh and then this was the last thing i kind of needed to get over but like we do math and like uh uh and seo and you know change and you know can they do that and no theyre terrible uh and they dont know that going from 7 to 9 is not a great thing from a ranking perspective and the uh just really bad uh but i did figure out that theyre good at copy pasting right so they can do like cle and then they can copy paste and then i can come back and because they structure the output really nicely i can go back and say okay heres the prior heres the current and then we can do those calculations for the model uh and then looking at what contexts we can provide pretty good amount um scp sc the hell out of page feed insights rick uh and search engine performance from search console content analysis probably do some trends which would be really cool and hook it up to nozzle and hook it up to hrs and throw a bunch of stuff in there uh this is all the cool stuff from ga4 which i love the idea of like incorporating like next visits like what happened after people went to this page or how did they get to this page and you can like really think about like how to kind of massage the analysis that you want to throw in these buckets right to get the model to react to i think thats just cool so its called sep this is like a toy model right uh uh and uh the idea is like an eye in the cloud watching my content uh oh i love like releasing like open source little stupid projects uh for people to geek around with so thats if you didnt know thats my thing uh and its on github you can pull it down you can play around with it i will say that you need a developer um so hopefully you know a developer friend that can help you hook it up uh and then i normally try not to have dependencies that you pay for but like scraping be is like my favorite little thing because it takes away the rendering i dont have to think about like the rendering process i can just give it to scraping b and theyll render it and send it back to me and scraping that one has this code has a really interesting thing because with scraping b we throw in mozillas readability and mozillas readability library uh does a really good job of extracting like the really clean content from the page so theres also a solve there if you go through the code for some potential issues and then mael trap is just free so um but yeah those thats the things you have to set up also made like a really kind of easy structure here um tried to make it extensible so that you could add in easily different extractors for different things uh and then i think this is cool you have like a really easy setup so you get uh your data set up you get your ga set up you get your uh uh search console and then you can just like tell it heres what i want to see right and you can change this right um and then you get

and then anything thats in passes some importantance thresholds itll just email you and say hey this happened right which thats i think what i want right uh like heres a cool thing um we uh that it cau this page it just went from uh what is that a 16 change like those are the things that i dont want to have to like sit there and dig if it can just kind of pull that out for me and say hey you know you release this rel uh change on this page and hey it actually did really good and i can fire that off and say hey the page we optimized last month is doing really good right and itll kind of

        "raw_text": "[Applause] all right it's awesome great to see you all um for me this is a little bit personal because in 2018 uh I spoke at a conference called Tech SEO boost uh put up by Paul ch and the team uh and that said a lot of things in motion for me for my career and personally uh and I'll never forget how um Russ Jones uh rest in peace uh he he he has a very very provocative respectful and nice question at the end of my talk and it just set in motion so many new thoughts and Concepts and so there's a lot to learn here uh and again I I look back six years ago uh and now I'm here so this is somewhat personal for me um that being said welcome to the SEO ship show not to be confused with the SEO show that's going on lots of places but the SEO ship show as in getting things shipped and I want to start with a very quick meditation I want you all to close your eyes also the people streaming from YouTube and I want you to imagine the company that you work for or your client I want you to imagine that you get all of your recommendations sh shipped so everything you suggest everything recommend actually gets done and you learn from that and you beat your competitors and you come up with even better recommendations you're having impact and eventually you're getting promoted now I want you to close your eyes because that's usually not reality that's not what actually happens most of our stuff does not get shipped actually by show of hands raise your hands if more than half of your recommendations get out the door all right I I'll I'll just say that's 5 to 10% lucky you uh I asked the same thing to my uh Twitter followers and here um the picture is somewhat similar so actually less than 50% of recommendations get shipped half of the time so what that means is for 50% of people they only they ship 50% of less or less of what they actually recommend that's a lot of wasted work uh and that's a bit that's a big problem because if you think about it the best technical SEO trick or hack does not matter if it doesn't get implemented it's just vanity right so no shipping means no impact no impact means no purpose no purpose means no job it sounds very harsh but it's true at the end of the day we need to get things out of the door and that's my goal with this presentation is to help you ship recommendations instead of seeing them die in the backlog there's also number one question that I get from um the people that I engage with whether it's at conferences or uh newsletter subscribers um they all want to understand okay how do I get executive Buy in to get my stuff out of the door um Mike mentioned I had the privilege to to work for some incredible companies um and I'm not saying that toag maybe a little bit toag because I crave your approval um but the point is I'm not the most technical person here in the room by far there's a lot that I'm jealous of when it comes to Mike for example um I'm not the the best data person here in the room but one thing that had allowed me to progress in my career is that I get done I get out of the door and it's a skill set that I think is absolutely crucial and complimentary to your technical skills and so that's why today I want to share three contrasts with you that I have so to say learned over the last 12 13 14 years and the first one is the contrast between St Story versus database pitching it is um goal versus work and it is shallo versus deep recommendations so to jump in um story based pitching so everybody wants to be data driven we all like to say that we're data driven about ourselves however that's not always how goes it reminds me um on my time at Shopify so when I when I joined Shopify in 2020 um and we had a world class team we had world class tooling and for me it was kind of a a dream come true because For the First time ever did I work with SC data scientists and engineers and and and lots of smart people and we're able to project the impact of our recommendations maybe down to the single digit I was like wow it's amazing we can we can like really wow everyone with this with this refined kind of system that helps us understand the impact of our recommendations and what actually happened was not just crickets when I presented that to leadership but I actually got a lot of push back we got stuck in these conversations about the math and the methodology and how did we actually get to this number and why is it so precise and once we took a step back and actually like actually not rounded to the single digit but kept the projections a bit more high level but tied them to the mission and to the situation of the company all of a sudden things started flowing and things started moving so you can be too specific when it comes to data and the reality is that that's not always what works because the common assumption here is that Executives you know you can just they just need to see the right data or the right math formula and then they'll say yes to whatever you suggest the reality though is that we're much more driven by emotions and stories than we like to acknowledge as a matter of fact 95% % of all cognition occurs in the subconscious mind and what that means is that we make most decisions based on feelings whether we like to admit it or not so the White story is important um at the same time there's some data suggesting that almost half of Executives um rely much more on Instinct than facts and figures when running their business right which means that people are biased and if if their bias doesn't match the data you present it's really hard to convince people Okay Kevin so how do you get this right I want to give you three tips for getting bu in that is more story based and the first one is to actually tie your recommendation to the company situation a lot of people miss this right A lot of people will go out and they run they start screaming frog or some sort of crawler jet octopus they look at the data right they see some things that don't look right and they present it upwards but they completely miss the overall context and so the context can be for example an acceleration so are going really well um and and you just need to accelerate that Trend and of course there's the other reverse situation as well where oh this looks great uh this is basically time on the uh x-axis um but there's the other situation as well where you we need to turn things around right and that means you need a very different mindset with your recommendations and so there is a framework called Stars it's an acronym that describes the five different situations that we can find ourselves in um and that we can use to to make suggestions recommendations accordingly by the way I'll share the slides feel free take pictures just want to let you know if you cannot see this well uh you'll get the slides you get the recordings Etc um so five situations uh one is startup right so you get something new off the ground then there's the turnaround where you need to maybe save the business um there's accelerating growth which I showed earlier right things are going really well you just need to keep that that momentum going there's a situation of realignment where um you know things had been going but maybe are falling off you need to re-energize the team uh and then they're sustaining success where essentially don't f it up that's kind of the the situation that you're in but just knowing that allows you to speak to leadership in a very very different context and maybe prioritize different recommendations right if you're in a uh sustained success situation for example maybe you want to try some more daring things some more long-term projects whereas if you're in a Turner situation you tell leadership that this might not see uh Roi within you know before a year that's not going to land very well number two there are three things that leaders really care about and that is money market and exposure so essentially things like Revenue profit uh market share and risk and so any recommendation that you give needs to letter up to one of these three things that people care about but it's not just about the the gains here it's also about the stakes so a big mistake that I see that I made early on in my career was that it didn't focus on what's at risk here if we don't do these things I only focused on hey what can we get when we do these things but reality is that people care much more about minimizing risk than maximizing upside and so the the winning formula here is not just your point of view or the recommendation but also combining that with whatever is at risk if that doesn't happen number three um you want to make it personal so at Shopify I learned this this what was new to me at the time thing called back channeling where essentially you you have before you give a big presentation you actually meet with the leaders the decision makers one-onone and maybe you share some of the things you already want to present you get some of their feedback so they're not seeing it for the first time when it's in front of a big group and you can learn about some of their hesitations maybe some of their counter or pro- arguments you can maybe even persuade them you can learn about their optim their individual goals so what are they optimizing for what is their perspective right especially fruitful when it comes to engineering teams or design teams with you might which you might need to implement stuff and number three is the wording so this is very subtle but if you actually use the wording that from from from leaders or from decision makers that can really help you make them feel like they contributed so I I met with people as I I listen to how they call certain things and then I use that exact wording in my presentations so they saw themselves in that presentation and in that plan okay that's number one number two starting with the goal way too often we get very wrapped up and very excited about technical details uh and leaders are usually very overwhelmed by this so I was like that actually early on in my career uh I I I was proud of the length of my uh audits I turned around every diff tag I got super deep Long catalog of things that companies could do and that served me really well when I was a consultant on the agency side and then I went in house and I realized uh okay none of my stuff gets really executed right you get like a lot of Applause when you present these long cataloges but then nobody cares afterwards and only when I started to to call out what are the three things that we need to get done right now toning it down to just three things I actually saw some momentum and traction so the common assumption here is that Executives and decision makers they want to scrutinize everything they want to see all the details of your plan and the reality is that mostly leaderships care about the goal are we going to hit our goals and how are we going to get there and that's also supported by the data so 85% of leaders suffer from decision fatigue 85% so pretty much everyone and 72 admit that the sheer volume of data and lack of trust in data makes them so overwhelmed that they rather not make a decision at all so by actually having these bloated audits you increase your chance that nothing gets done or leaders are so overwhelmed that they don't know where to start so how do you start with the goal one of my favorite practices is from uh Amazon where they where they start by working backwards it's also a great book that I can strongly recommend um and a way to work backwards is to start with a press release so you don't need to actually write a full press release for yourself but whenever you have a catalog of recommendations you want to ask yourself okay first of all you want to grab attention right starting a presentation to leadership with a strong punch line always works really well you need to back it up with with data too right but grab the attention leaders are chronically overwhelmed and underst starved on attention um you want to clearly defin the problems that you solve for the customers of the business right that's a completely different approach than starting with technical errors in report right so start with the customers start with the Northstar of the business you want to describe the benefits of what you're trying to do to the customers and then at the end you want to get into some of the more technical weeds and some of the questions you also want to speak to how Executives think um I had the privilege of of having VP and director positions before and um I I can I can confirm that you don't have enough brain capacity and time to think through everything right so the the common Logic the common structure as an executive is to start with okay is this going to help with our goal or what is the goal of this recommendation what is the effort needed for us to get there what are the timings so can we get this done in a week in a day or in a year and then who is responsible for that and by structuring your presentations whether it's a slide deck whether it's written or ver whether it's on the on the verbal Track by structuring them in that logic you help executive think along what you're actually trying to get to and then the last one is um to to ditch the details right as I mentioned earlier people are chronically overwhelmed by too many details and you actually want to avoid some common red flags in communication I see this all the time uh I'm sitting in a lot of leadership meetings these days and I see more Junior people present the leadership and they make these mistakes a lot of time so they they first of all they they mention too many details that don't matter at all right it's a lot of fluff um they make big claims that are very hard to support and the problem is when somebody digs in and realizes that the claim that that there's nothing that these claims stand on that cost you a lot of trust that can be that can be devastating for your career same for clients by the way uh and then they they doubt their themselves too much right they they make recommendations or claims that they don't present confidently that also erods trust with leadership and on the other hand as I mentioned earlier you can can strengthen your pitches by focusing on Revenue market share and exposure um you can you can focus on the wins here and you can be very clear about the problems and solutions right at the end of the day the best pitch or the best communication with leadership is when at the end of the pitch leadership just has to say yes or no right if you say hey this is the problem here are the three options that we're facing this is why where we're picking this option do you agree yes or no that's usually the best way to go about it that brings me to number three most of our recommendations are way too shallow so had this moment recently um at a at a big client uh you're you're all using their products you all know the company um and there was an issue where search console reported over 50,000 Pages where Google chose a different canonical than the user or than than the site indicated and an agency that this company works with um this was their I have to read this off this was their uh the recommendation fix incorrect usage of directives and create a plan to improve International indexation so if you get that as an engineering team you don't know what to do with that right like that means you now need to go and do Discovery yourself which means understanding what the problem is why it's a problem how to potentially fix it make sure you have the right fix how to qway it like you just waste so much time you're going to reject this as a good engineering team you're going to say this is we have no no idea what to do here uh and and we don't even know what what we're uh how to how to solve this and so the problem was caused by English content in international markets right so you go to to the blog of this company or to the landing pages and some of that content was simply in English so Google mistrusted the self- referencing canonical and just said no the canonical should go to the US site that is that is kind of the underlying issue here and so by going to the team and saying look we got to fix the way that we display localized content in international markets you actually help them uncover what to do and this is an example of shallow versus deep recommendations so again the the the common misconception here is that teams that we work with engineering design content data whatever they just know what we want they'll figure out what we want if we show them the problem but the reality is that if we miss Clarity we increase the chance significantly that our work will not get done so 85 86% of Executives actually identify poor communication is one of the biggest reasons for why projects fail that's a lot and I think it's a good push that we can all be a bit clearer in the recommendations and the asks of the teams that we work with because at the end of the day SEO is a recommendation discipline right most of the stuff that we do is give recommendations to other teams now that might change with AI but that's a different topic so how do you do things clear or make things clear well first of all um it's about the root causes of things right we often get stuck at the second layer which is the symptom right what do we see as an error report somewhere what do our tools tell us or what looks wrong when we look at it that often reflects in an outcome but the root cause is was really really important here so um you might not see this well on the slides but an outcome could be that our ranks or organic traffic dropped okay that's a problem um the symptom could be that there are four or four errors from the pages that lost r but that's not the root cause the root cause is why are these four fours occurring and it could be something like a database crash or some problem with the CMS or some misconfiguration or something else but that's the layer that we actually need to focus on when we package the work for our partners talking about packaging so there's a couple things you can do right and wrong when it comes to packaging um a lot of times again I see audits where the problem is being described but there's not enough context for why this actually is a problem um again a lot of seos assume that teams know what they want but in many cases there are multiple ways to solve a problem that SEO describ so you want to you want to be specific about the task you want to split it ideally into subtasks most problems are um or for most problems you need to actually fix several things than just one uh you don't want to be vague you want to be as specific as you can and don't make the mistake of just I've see this all the time don't just send spreadsheets to engineering teams and be like hey here's a list of all the four fours like that's that's lazy that's not good um you also want to describe the ideal outcome and this is also something that I learned painfully in my career but when you talk to these teams when you talk to leaders um and they ask you why is this a problem like what's we often get stuck in these oh well Google said but uh here here's what we what we listen to Google but generally you should not listen to Google and you get like stuck in these these weird Loops where you counter argue yourself and so three questions that I constantly keep top of mind when I give recommendations is what is the number that I'm trying to move and it's not always organic traffic or ranks right what are the what is the way to measure whether we're successful where should that number ideally be what's the ideal value for that number and why should it be there and that's a hard question to answer in lots of cases but if you get that logic sound again people will Implement more of this stuff that you suggest so this could be the number that you're trying to move could be four or four errors in search console right now where should that number be should it be zero is zero realistic probably not because stuff keeps coming up so let's set a threshold of no more than 50 and you can even argue why 50 why not 25 why not 100 right um and so by by thinking about these questions you start to get more clarity for yourself but you also provide a lot more clarity for the teams you partner with and now we could for example say say hey engineering team why don't we have a joint goal of keeping this number at that level together and then you don't constantly have to chase you actually get people to co-create with you and collaborate with you so wrapping all that up um you build you need a story right for most of your stuff you need a story um that typically relates back to customers target audience not startup of the business but spin your story around something that leadership cares about um you want to speak exact quote unquote right so when you pitch to leaders to customers to decision makers you want to use not just their wording but also present in the way that they think not Bottoms Up don't start with the work don't start with the details and you want to make it easy for teams that collaborate with you to implement the work instead of having to do Discovery themselves again at the end of the day the best hack or or finding is nothing without implementation uh but it really goes back to audits sorry it goes away from audits it it goes back to things like better stories pitches and packaging and the cool thing is that once you have momentum and shipping right you can build on that if you get things out of the door you gain more trust um you get more stuff done you learn faster and leaders are willing to do more daring projects with you I share insights like that every week uh in in the uh my newsletter called the growth memo Adam Gans who's another brilliant Tech SEO call it the best news newsletter on SEO growth with insid case studies and so um it's it's a free Weekly Newsletter growth-curve all the impact you can make and the things that you can learn and so I want to send you off with a question here which is if you could build anything what would you build and now you hopefully know how to get there thank you very much",
        "cleaned_text": "applause all right its awesome great to see you all um for me this is a little bit personal because in 2018 uh i spoke at a conference called tech seo boost uh put up by paul ch and the team uh and that said a lot of things in motion for me for my career and personally uh and ill never forget how um russ jones uh rest in peace uh he he he has a very very provocative respectful and nice question at the end of my talk and it just set in motion so many new thoughts and concepts and so theres a lot to learn here uh and again i i look back six years ago uh and now im here so this is somewhat personal for me um that being said welcome to the seo ship show not to be confused with the seo show thats going on lots of places but the seo ship show as in getting things shipped and i want to start with a very quick meditation i want you all to close your eyes also the people streaming from youtube and i want you to imagine the company that you work for or your client i want you to imagine that you get all of your recommendations sh shipped so everything you suggest everything recommend actually gets done and you learn from that and you beat your competitors and you come up with even better recommendations youre having impact and eventually youre getting promoted now i want you to close your eyes because thats usually not reality thats not what actually happens most of our stuff does not get shipped actually by show of hands raise your hands if more than half of your recommendations get out the door all right i ill ill just say thats 5 to 10 lucky you uh i asked the same thing to my uh twitter followers and here um the picture is somewhat similar so actually less than 50 of recommendations get shipped half of the time so what that means is for 50 of people they only they ship 50 of less or less of what they actually recommend thats a lot of wasted work uh and thats a bit thats a big problem because if you think about it the best technical seo trick or hack does not matter if it doesnt get implemented its just vanity right so no shipping means no impact no impact means no purpose no purpose means no job it sounds very harsh but its true at the end of the day we need to get things out of the door and thats my goal with this presentation is to help you ship recommendations instead of seeing them die in the backlog theres also number one question that i get from um the people that i engage with whether its at conferences or uh newsletter subscribers um they all want to understand okay how do i get executive buy in to get my stuff out of the door um mike mentioned i had the privilege to to work for some incredible companies um and im not saying that toag maybe a little bit toag because i crave your approval um but the point is im not the most technical person here in the room by far theres a lot that im jealous of when it comes to mike for example um im not the the best data person here in the room but one thing that had allowed me to progress in my career is that i get done i get out of the door and its a skill set that i think is absolutely crucial and complimentary to your technical skills and so thats why today i want to share three contrasts with you that i have so to say learned over the last 12 13 14 years and the first one is the contrast between st story versus database pitching it is um goal versus work and it is shallo versus deep recommendations so to jump in um story based pitching so everybody wants to be data driven we all like to say that were data driven about ourselves however thats not always how goes it reminds me um on my time at shopify so when i when i joined shopify in 2020 um and we had a world class team we had world class tooling and for me it was kind of a a dream come true because for the first time ever did i work with sc data scientists and engineers and and and lots of smart people and were able to project the impact of our recommendations maybe down to the single digit i was like wow its amazing we can we can like really wow everyone with this with this refined kind of system that helps us understand the impact of our recommendations and what actually happened was not just crickets when i presented that to leadership but i actually got a lot of push back we got stuck in these conversations about the math and the methodology and how did we actually get to this number and why is it so precise and once we took a step back and actually like actually not rounded to the single digit but kept the projections a bit more high level but tied them to the mission and to the situation of the company all of a sudden things started flowing and things started moving so you can be too specific when it comes to data and the reality is that thats not always what works because the common assumption here is that executives you know you can just they just need to see the right data or the right math formula and then theyll say yes to whatever you suggest the reality though is that were much more driven by emotions and stories than we like to acknowledge as a matter of fact 95  of all cognition occurs in the subconscious mind and what that means is that we make most decisions based on feelings whether we like to admit it or not so the white story is important um at the same time theres some data suggesting that almost half of executives um rely much more on instinct than facts and figures when running their business right which means that people are biased and if if their bias doesnt match the data you present its really hard to convince people okay kevin so how do you get this right i want to give you three tips for getting bu in that is more story based and the first one is to actually tie your recommendation to the company situation a lot of people miss this right a lot of people will go out and they run they start screaming frog or some sort of crawler jet octopus they look at the data right they see some things that dont look right and they present it upwards but they completely miss the overall context and so the context can be for example an acceleration so are going really well um and and you just need to accelerate that trend and of course theres the other reverse situation as well where oh this looks great uh this is basically time on the uh xaxis um but theres the other situation as well where you we need to turn things around right and that means you need a very different mindset with your recommendations and so there is a framework called stars its an acronym that describes the five different situations that we can find ourselves in um and that we can use to to make suggestions recommendations accordingly by the way ill share the slides feel free take pictures just want to let you know if you cannot see this well uh youll get the slides you get the recordings etc um so five situations uh one is startup right so you get something new off the ground then theres the turnaround where you need to maybe save the business um theres accelerating growth which i showed earlier right things are going really well you just need to keep that that momentum going theres a situation of realignment where um you know things had been going but maybe are falling off you need to reenergize the team uh and then theyre sustaining success where essentially dont f it up thats kind of the the situation that youre in but just knowing that allows you to speak to leadership in a very very different context and maybe prioritize different recommendations right if youre in a uh sustained success situation for example maybe you want to try some more daring things some more longterm projects whereas if youre in a turner situation you tell leadership that this might not see uh roi within you know before a year thats not going to land very well number two there are three things that leaders really care about and that is money market and exposure so essentially things like revenue profit uh market share and risk and so any recommendation that you give needs to letter up to one of these three things that people care about but its not just about the the gains here its also about the stakes so a big mistake that i see that i made early on in my career was that it didnt focus on whats at risk here if we dont do these things i only focused on hey what can we get when we do these things but reality is that people care much more about minimizing risk than maximizing upside and so the the winning formula here is not just your point of view or the recommendation but also combining that with whatever is at risk if that doesnt happen number three um you want to make it personal so at shopify i learned this this what was new to me at the time thing called back channeling where essentially you you have before you give a big presentation you actually meet with the leaders the decision makers oneonone and maybe you share some of the things you already want to present you get some of their feedback so theyre not seeing it for the first time when its in front of a big group and you can learn about some of their hesitations maybe some of their counter or pro arguments you can maybe even persuade them you can learn about their optim their individual goals so what are they optimizing for what is their perspective right especially fruitful when it comes to engineering teams or design teams with you might which you might need to implement stuff and number three is the wording so this is very subtle but if you actually use the wording that from from from leaders or from decision makers that can really help you make them feel like they contributed so i i met with people as i i listen to how they call certain things and then i use that exact wording in my presentations so they saw themselves in that presentation and in that plan okay thats number one number two starting with the goal way too often we get very wrapped up and very excited about technical details uh and leaders are usually very overwhelmed by this so i was like that actually early on in my career uh i i i was proud of the length of my uh audits i turned around every diff tag i got super deep long catalog of things that companies could do and that served me really well when i was a consultant on the agency side and then i went in house and i realized uh okay none of my stuff gets really executed right you get like a lot of applause when you present these long cataloges but then nobody cares afterwards and only when i started to to call out what are the three things that we need to get done right now toning it down to just three things i actually saw some momentum and traction so the common assumption here is that executives and decision makers they want to scrutinize everything they want to see all the details of your plan and the reality is that mostly leaderships care about the goal are we going to hit our goals and how are we going to get there and thats also supported by the data so 85 of leaders suffer from decision fatigue 85 so pretty much everyone and 72 admit that the sheer volume of data and lack of trust in data makes them so overwhelmed that they rather not make a decision at all so by actually having these bloated audits you increase your chance that nothing gets done or leaders are so overwhelmed that they dont know where to start so how do you start with the goal one of my favorite practices is from uh amazon where they where they start by working backwards its also a great book that i can strongly recommend um and a way to work backwards is to start with a press release so you dont need to actually write a full press release for yourself but whenever you have a catalog of recommendations you want to ask yourself okay first of all you want to grab attention right starting a presentation to leadership with a strong punch line always works really well you need to back it up with with data too right but grab the attention leaders are chronically overwhelmed and underst starved on attention um you want to clearly defin the problems that you solve for the customers of the business right thats a completely different approach than starting with technical errors in report right so start with the customers start with the northstar of the business you want to describe the benefits of what youre trying to do to the customers and then at the end you want to get into some of the more technical weeds and some of the questions you also want to speak to how executives think um i had the privilege of of having vp and director positions before and um i i can i can confirm that you dont have enough brain capacity and time to think through everything right so the the common logic the common structure as an executive is to start with okay is this going to help with our goal or what is the goal of this recommendation what is the effort needed for us to get there what are the timings so can we get this done in a week in a day or in a year and then who is responsible for that and by structuring your presentations whether its a slide deck whether its written or ver whether its on the on the verbal track by structuring them in that logic you help executive think along what youre actually trying to get to and then the last one is um to to ditch the details right as i mentioned earlier people are chronically overwhelmed by too many details and you actually want to avoid some common red flags in communication i see this all the time uh im sitting in a lot of leadership meetings these days and i see more junior people present the leadership and they make these mistakes a lot of time so they they first of all they they mention too many details that dont matter at all right its a lot of fluff um they make big claims that are very hard to support and the problem is when somebody digs in and realizes that the claim that that theres nothing that these claims stand on that cost you a lot of trust that can be that can be devastating for your career same for clients by the way uh and then they they doubt their themselves too much right they they make recommendations or claims that they dont present confidently that also erods trust with leadership and on the other hand as i mentioned earlier you can can strengthen your pitches by focusing on revenue market share and exposure um you can you can focus on the wins here and you can be very clear about the problems and solutions right at the end of the day the best pitch or the best communication with leadership is when at the end of the pitch leadership just has to say yes or no right if you say hey this is the problem here are the three options that were facing this is why where were picking this option do you agree yes or no thats usually the best way to go about it that brings me to number three most of our recommendations are way too shallow so had this moment recently um at a at a big client uh youre youre all using their products you all know the company um and there was an issue where search console reported over 50000 pages where google chose a different canonical than the user or than than the site indicated and an agency that this company works with um this was their i have to read this off this was their uh the recommendation fix incorrect usage of directives and create a plan to improve international indexation so if you get that as an engineering team you dont know what to do with that right like that means you now need to go and do discovery yourself which means understanding what the problem is why its a problem how to potentially fix it make sure you have the right fix how to qway it like you just waste so much time youre going to reject this as a good engineering team youre going to say this is we have no no idea what to do here uh and and we dont even know what what were uh how to how to solve this and so the problem was caused by english content in international markets right so you go to to the blog of this company or to the landing pages and some of that content was simply in english so google mistrusted the self referencing canonical and just said no the canonical should go to the us site that is that is kind of the underlying issue here and so by going to the team and saying look we got to fix the way that we display localized content in international markets you actually help them uncover what to do and this is an example of shallow versus deep recommendations so again the the the common misconception here is that teams that we work with engineering design content data whatever they just know what we want theyll figure out what we want if we show them the problem but the reality is that if we miss clarity we increase the chance significantly that our work will not get done so 85 86 of executives actually identify poor communication is one of the biggest reasons for why projects fail thats a lot and i think its a good push that we can all be a bit clearer in the recommendations and the asks of the teams that we work with because at the end of the day seo is a recommendation discipline right most of the stuff that we do is give recommendations to other teams now that might change with ai but

I love I'm so short yeah I can walk across and not block the the slides love it okay uh so yes I am Sam Torres I I don't know what happened there um I was originally a developer before this I did front end um came to marketing uh actually because I wanted to be in visual merchandising which really makes no sense how I'm here now but here I am uh I've been doing it for about 14 years and now I get to run the company with my partner Tori gray uh we have way too much fun solving really complex problems for our clients um and then I am a super uh member of women and Tech SEO which is amazing Shameless call out um if you are here today and you identify as female or another marginalized gender please please join it is free that Community has literally changed my life that's how I met Tori um and It's amazing And for those who do not identify as female you can still get involved subscribe to our newsletter uh it's incredible content and it's always promoting women uh and just the amazing things that they are creating that Community is phenomenal uh the most encouraging slack Community you will ever find in your life it's awesome all right but that's not really what we're here to talk about today um well I'm always ready to talk about that but we're going to talk about this um so do I I do want to see who feels Vic IED by Google search console's 16-month window yep and now we get to have it with G4 you only get 14 months that's super great right uh and then also have you ever run into a time where you're looking at a liquor Studio report and you're talking to a client or maybe a customer and you're like I promise the report is here it's just taking a really long time um that is the most awkward pause and one of the ones I hate the most um so I'm going to try to help you those problems and we're going to do all of it with bigquery so obviously we've been talking about it a lot Noah did a great talk about it surge as well um how do you get that data out of GSC and into big query uh Google actually made it really easy for us now so what I'm going to cover in here we're going to talk about what is Big query why would you want to use it uh there's obviously I'm biased and I have a lot of reasons why uh we're going to talk about how the pricing works too cuz maybe you've seen the horror stories of oh my God I got a $50,000 bill with Google um from Big query I'm going to help you avoid that um we're also going to talk about how do you even navigate the platform because it looks kind of terrifying especially if you've worked really with the marketing side of Google products when you go into Google Cloud console it is overwhelming and even I as a developer find it overwhelming um and then we're going to talk about something I call aggregate tables now for any of my data scientists in the room I know that there are aggregate functions in big query it's not the same uh this is what I call it um so again not an industry term don't tell your data scientists that's what they're called because it's not really but that's what I call them because it makes sense to me um if you do want the slides you can download them here uh they're already up there uh so I'll leave it here for two seconds and then there's another one at the end so all right so let's get started is bit query even worth it seems a little bit overwhelming sometimes especially when you first log in so let's talk about what is it just kidding I fixed it I'm never going to read that much to you guys I don't hate anyone that much um so really the important things here that this is saying is that it is a place to store your data you can store a ton of it you can query it really quickly and then it's also an infrastructure that you don't have to manage all of that is already done for you and then the other piece I want to call it here is that you use SQL to navigate it why is that important SQL is old as dirt which means there is a ton of documentation on it there are a ton of tools to help you figure out how to use it um so there's just there's already a community of support to make it that much easier to interact with your data so what are the benefits um you get to scale it's unsampled right if you uh you know we've been seeing about the API we actually start getting some of that data Noah was calling out how you can see if it's an anonymized query right we get all of that actually already in big query um if you're like me and you actually have to work across different platforms or maybe you have integrated campaigns with your clients you're logging into Google ads and meta and Linkedin and Tik Tok and Reddit advertising and everything else in order to see your data a lot of those tools have availability for you to put that data in big query as well so it could potentially become the One Source where your information where your data lives um and again you can do a lot of things and as far as access data back to day one Once you turn on the Integrations um we're going to talk a little bit more but basically any of the calculations you do retroactively applies to any of the data you already have um so let's continue again so why doesn't everybody use it um this is the homepage for Google Cloud console which is how you get to Big query um can you tell me where big query is yeah it's it's it's and it moves on you it's not great um so we also need to of course talk about the pricing because nobody wants prize bills and unfortunately when you read the pricing documentation for big query it's like what the what that means nothing to me um so I'm going to tell you there's really two things two factors that decide how much your bill is going to be the first is storage so this is just how much data are you actually holding in big query uh the free tier actually gets you 10 gigs which doesn't sound like much but y'all it's basically like csvs so imagine 10 gigs of csvs that is a ton of data um I have Enterprise clients that they will have anywhere from six to 8 million URLs at a time depending on their inventory we are nowhere close the storage is fine storage is cheap and even if you were to extend past that storage is still cheap like to double that is like 15 cents a month so if you're paying a lot for storage uh you're getting screwed um and then after that is computation so this is where how much are you are you actually interacting with the data are you transforming it are you pulling it all that kind of good stuff uh the free tier gets you a terabyte which you're like oh that sounds like a lot unfortunately it's not um so this is where things start to get really expensive um if you're not smart about how you're querying and interacting with your data so if you do find that cost are up there's probably some really inefficient queries um and anytime I've seen the horror stories of those I was not expecting this $5,000 bill that's that's been what's happened um also to give you context I do I I'm fortunate my agency has a number of Enterprise clients and we have set up these systems for them most of my clients are still under $10 a month and the reporting is coming from it we're doing basically using only big query as our source for data and it's still less than 10 bucks uh my agency we definitely don't even come close to ever having to pay anything cuz well we're an agency website so you know it happens um so let's talk about the compute cost how does it how does it build up so this is a liquor Studio report that we put together for ourselves actually and this single chart that's showing the Branded impression share seems like a really simple chart right it's things we do all the time well what's happening here is that single Le query to build that report is having to look through and find specific keywords query The Impressions for that um and then also organize it by date so there's already multiple functions happening here that seem really simple but start to add up really quickly so when you're going through this um you can create budget alerts so this is a way to make sure you don't get that surprise bill or at least you can't faint IGN ignorance anymore I guess would be part of a bad part um so when you're going into Google search console I'm sorry not search console Cloud console I'm going to do that so many times um you can create a budget um I'm not going to walk you through all of the screenshots because you're Tech seos which means you're probably really good at following documentation um but you can set all these up so I'll just talk a few through a few things um when you're specifying your budget you can actually apply it to just specific organizations so if you're agency and you have different clients in there you can although I would highly recommend uh still make sure the client's credit card is on it just in case somebody on their side gets stupid and plays with stuff uh not that any of my clients would ever do that it's happened um and then you can also limit it by project or even a service so if maybe your client does already have a Google Cloud console account or you do because you're doing other fun things with machine learning um you can just limit it based on whatever service you're running um this is really important if you if your organization does have an account and maybe your the app that's powering your service runs through here uh you don't want to limit what they're doing but obviously you want to limit the cost you're causing um you can create alert thresholds you can make these emails as annoying as you want to and if you want to add the finance person on the email alerts um that's how you do it so again you'll have the slides so you can look at this later um some of my favorite sample budgets um um Google really likes to push last month spend that's the one it's always going to default too uh my favorite is any I want to know if I'm spending anything um cuz even if there's one day where it's like hey suddenly something costs 30 cents I want to know about it because a lot of times that could be a sign that a query started um and I want to make sure it's not going to run multiple times that day or multiple times that month um and then again you can limit to the specific services and those are the services that you would limit it to okay so now we've talked about budgeting so let's actually get started and like do something with it how do we connect it so this has to be one of my favorite things that Google ever gave us is the bulk export from GSC um it's also the reason why my agency we actually used to work in Snowflake or red shift for any kind of data storage that single thing kind of forced us to learn bigquery so I guess it was really smart of them I don't know um okay so when you start you do have to create a bilding account and you've probably already set up your budget if you don't do this part before you try to connect everything you will run into blockers you also will have different limitations so all you have to do is add a credit card it won't get charged um but I can say I think if you don't add a credit card then you're limited to like 11 projects once you add it you have up to 100 and you can always pay for more of course Google will let you pay for more um so you're going to create a project now when thinking about projects think about how you want them to be separated we'll talk a little bit more about that and again I'm not going to walk you through all these things but you do have to enable the API the first time that's kind of an important piece um I talk about how to find that for GSC this one is kind of a pain in the butt uh you actually have to go through and add specific users that make no sense so it's like this search console data export um I don't I I would never expect anyone to have that memorized so definitely look through the documentation you assign the types of jobs you want them to do and then now you're going to go into GSC into your settings and turn on the bulk data export the important part here uh if you forgot what your project ID is when you need to fill it in uh this is how you find it back in Cloud console and when you are setting your location don't it up um it is really hard to fix later so if I because we're here I'm assuming probably most of us our data governance is based on us laws but if you are deal with gdpr um you need to put in whatever's there uh bigquery does a great job of making sure that your data stays compliant that the infrastructure is protected uh so that's that's why that's really important um and data set name so you'll see that when it comes through so if you are combining multiple Properties or maybe you're combining the different subfolders that Serge was talking about um that's a great way that you can start differentiating but search conso is always going to be there okay once you've turned it on you'll see this level bulk data export is active it takes 24 to 48 hours for the data to start coming through so unfortunately this is not one of those projects where you can totally forget to do it and then do it 15 minutes before you're meeting with your boss and be like see it's here no it's going to take a day sorry y'all um and then you'll start see it coming through looks like that so let's talk about G4 again create a project or you could use the same one it really just depends on what kind of organization works for you the things I like to consider is do I want to have separate budgets um and then also kind of the size across the different projects um I'm also just kind of a control freak so I separate everything but I realized not everybody wants to do that um they made it a whole lot easier in ja4 I don't have to do all that permissions crap I literally just go to big query links in the configuration find my project um and put it all together the only thing here again you got to select the right location is really really hard when you get this wrong again not that any clients have ever done that um so at this point you get to configure your stream data so what are you going to pull in the important part here you only get to pull in 1 million events per day so for some Enterprise clients that does mean you're going to have more than one stream uh but it also means even for smaller sites start limiting according to what you actually need right um View uh I think yeah that's going to be really hard to see but one of the things on here that I'm excluding an event is view item list this client is not e-commerce so we don't need that event it's already part of G4 but basically that's just collecting a lot of fluff and in fact the fact that y'all probably can't see but it's got like an event count or volume I have no idea how like ga4 I don't know where you're call getting that from but it's super cool again takes 24 to 48 hours unfortunately and then the tables in big query for G4 look a little bit scarier but I promise it's not too bad okay so now you've got all your dat pulling and you're like I should connect this to lior Studio no please don't because again that's where you would start adding a lot of uh query or compute time you could find yourself uh really paying for a lot because if you connect uh lior Studio to just those big query tables that is the raw data set there'd be a lot of filtering going on all of the time so so don't do that not not just yet but okay so we're not going to get there yet I promise we will but let's talk about how do we even get around bigquery so uh Noah was actually talking about this that with uh the export there are two tables that come through you have either site or URL Impressions you all sell that's where the Ser feature data lives is the individual um if I'm doing testing and like playing with queries I always try it on the site first and then build from there um and so this is what your tables end up looking like uh so this is actually the individual URLs I have what property is it what is the actual URL my query and then you can see there's actually a lot of them just for this single homepage and that's because I actually have a different Row for every time a different Ser feature actually shows up now ga4 this is where it gets a little bit more complicated um there is a table that's created for every single day so it starts to get pretty expansive um from the look but just know it's you're it's still very manageable um and they also do a lot of nesting so even think about when we make schema and we have to Nest the postal address and it's got all the different Geo targets the same things are happening in G4 where we have a bunch of nesting going on um but it's all linked to an individual event name so do consider that for G4 it all starts with the event so that's always going to be kind of our our most basic item or element with j4 data so yeah so in bigquery it looks like this where I get a time stamp and I get what my event name y'all probably can't see that but it says first visit and then I have everything else that kind of goes with it um anytime you want to know what kind of fields are actually being gathered you can go to the schema tab in big query I highly recommend looking at this um because it also gives you an idea of what kind of data can you collect how can you organize um sometimes there's more in there that well at least for me what has happened quite a few times is there's a lot more detail in there than I considered and it gets your wheels going as far as like o i could be really creepy and start tracking these things which okay so now there's just a ton of tables and how does that really help you I totally get there's there's a ton well now we're going to talk about SQL right I was talking about that before uh Mike mentioned it yesterday that I'd be talking about it um yeah again it's really old um but that's how we interact with the data we create queries to get back the data that we want um and yes this is a this is a sample query I'll walk you through how they work so first you have your select statement so this is where what data do I actually want to pull right what are the metrics what's the information that I actually want from is just where do I actually want this to come from so really important especially if you are combining cross tables so I've actually I've absolutely built reports where we fill in GSC data and we're able to link it to G4 to show a full funnel uh where would be any kind of filtering so um in the sample I just showed you one of those was okay I don't want the query to be null and I want it to be people in the US CU that's the majority of what I uh customers that I service and then order bu is just how do you want that to be ordered how do you want that to to be separated to you okay queries can be super simple like this or they can get really crazy which is why I don't write them myself tools do I don't know why I would ever write my own SQL query anymore except to make fake ones for presentations um so this is my favorite tool ga4 for SQL um it actually so it is a generator it is not an AI tool which also means it's more eco-friendly um I do also really like this one they've got it for both G4 and GSC uh but basically it just provides a really nice goey for selecting the things that you want and they stake up to date as far as how Google names things so like when they changed from conversions to key events I think it took the guys three days to update the tool so um and it's completely free and I love free stuff because who doesn't um so with a query when you run it you'll actually get your query results right in front of you okay so now we know how to work with the data so let's actually talk about the magic how am I going to make sure that you don't get charged a bunch of money which by the way if you screwed up and you get charged a bunch of money disclaimer I don't owe you anything I am a small business owner I have a kid he's really expensive um all right so the the process that we're going to do with this is first you're going to use your measurement plan which Shameless plug we have in fact written an entire article about how to create a measurement plan and we give away a template um and actually if you download the slides there's a link to all that the reason why I love measurement plans and something to know about me is just in general I love documentation because I don't want to have to remember things later because that's just too much work um so in a measurement plan what it should be doing is actually saying okay here's all the things I'm going to measure here are the things I actually care about um and one of my favorites is also here's how I'm tracking those things that becomes really useful when you know maybe Andy from design decides to change all your buttons and he didn't ask you about it he just changed everything and now you can't track anything um that's a way that you can start diagnosing makes it much easier so definitely use a measurement plan that's going to help us identify what data we actually care about then we're going to create some tables and then we're going to set up a job so that that table updates every day as new data comes in from the bulk export and then those new tables are the ones that we're going to connect to looker studio and we'll talk more about why okay so when it comes to decide what data you want again use your measurement plan um the first ones I always start with are these so I just want to see things by Page by device by country all that good stuff um event data as well how do people enter my site based on what channels all that good stuff and I would say start small just build a few uh one of the reasons I love front-end development is because of the instant gratification right we're able to code things and immediately see that it's working uh so again let yourself have a few wins don't try to tackle everything at once you will drive yourself crazy and I guess we're probably all a little bit crazy because we're Tech seos but let's try to slow the rooll as much as we can um and again also think about all of your data is in big query already well once you turn it on um so anything you collect after that if I the data I'm collecting now if I were to make a query next year it's still going to go through my entire database because all of that data still lives there now obviously it can't make up data so if you have a problem of custom events aren't tracking that's not going to fix it uh but anything that's already there you're going to be able to go back and retroactively C calculate so after that you now know what you're pulling you use one of the tools to write a SQL query for you Explorer not to be confused with Noah's Explorer from what two October's um that's a big query calls their their preview paints um one of the things to note here when you go to write a query many times it'll actually show you I know there's supposed to be a laser pointer on here I have no idea how to use it okay um it'll actually tell you how much computation power it'll take to run it so again that's where you can start getting an idea of this might be a really inefficient quer um which is also why when I'm testing I always add this limit thousand uh that's to give me an idea of is this actually the data that I want um so that I'm not wasting all my budget in playing around because I feel like Tech seos that's what we love to do that's why we do what we do um all right so you you press the button run it's really this is one of those times for Google's trying to trick us um and then you get your results you can actually save them into a big qu table so you're going to go ahead and name that big query table whatever you want it to be I recommend not being super fun or creative with it so that you know what it is later uh so for example this one is just my sitewide queries and clicks so I just wanted to know what are all the queries that my site has and how many clicks and Impressions is getting um and I have it by day actually all right so n it's going to be my table that has worked through my entire data set that's already existing whether it's been there for a week or data that's been there for a year we finally uh that's going to be kind of like what sets the base for that table so now I'm going to take that same exact query but I'm going to change it to only look for yesterday's date now if you're a really large site I would actually recommend doing two days before um and that's because the bulk export when it decides to do it can vary wildly um and then also if you are a site that's used to having to wait 48 hours to see your data in gsse anyways you're probably going to run into the same problem so maybe I'll uh so for small sites again I would just do yesterday but for our larger Brands we do two days ago um because what I'm going to do now is actually hit that schedule button so I mean I'm going to test the query to make sure it works but I'm going to schedule it and what I'm going to do is make sure that it appends to that table I created earlier so that's the table I'm going to use that sitewide queries and clicks that's the table I'm going to use to start generating my liquor Studio reports why that calculation is only happening once per day if I wasn't if that looker Studio report was still connecting to the raw data set that means every time someone loaded that liquor Studio report those queries would be run literally every time and I don't know if you all have clients like I've had where you think honestly they're they're refreshing it all day I don't know what else they do then look at that um so or like we've also had clients where we set up real-time monitoring dashboards obviously this is not a use case where you can do that because we're waiting on a delay from G4 and GSC there's really nothing we can do about that um or if there is I don't know it um but you know that would just be constantly refreshing you would absolutely see a big Bill or possibly in liquor Studio start getting your quota exceeded messaging which is not infuriating at all um and that's that's pretty much it I went really fast all right",
        "cleaned_text": "applause thank you uh also for those standing in the front or sitting youre not standing uh i talk with my hands a lot so if this ends up in your face im really sorry um also i love im so short yeah i can walk across and not block the the slides love it okay uh so yes i am sam torres i i dont know what happened there um i was originally a developer before this i did front end um came to marketing uh actually because i wanted to be in visual merchandising which really makes no sense how im here now but here i am uh ive been doing it for about 14 years and now i get to run the company with my partner tori gray uh we have way too much fun solving really complex problems for our clients um and then i am a super uh member of women and tech seo which is amazing shameless call out um if you are here today and you identify as female or another marginalized gender please please join it is free that community has literally changed my life thats how i met tori um and its amazing and for those who do not identify as female you can still get involved subscribe to our newsletter uh its incredible content and its always promoting women uh and just the amazing things that they are creating that community is phenomenal uh the most encouraging slack community you will ever find in your life its awesome all right but thats not really what were here to talk about today um well im always ready to talk about that but were going to talk about this um so do i i do want to see who feels vic ied by google search consoles 16month window yep and now we get to have it with g4 you only get 14 months thats super great right uh and then also have you ever run into a time where youre looking at a liquor studio report and youre talking to a client or maybe a customer and youre like i promise the report is here its just taking a really long time um that is the most awkward pause and one of the ones i hate the most um so im going to try to help you those problems and were going to do all of it with bigquery so obviously weve been talking about it a lot noah did a great talk about it surge as well um how do you get that data out of gsc and into big query uh google actually made it really easy for us now so what im going to cover in here were going to talk about what is big query why would you want to use it uh theres obviously im biased and i have a lot of reasons why uh were going to talk about how the pricing works too cuz maybe youve seen the horror stories of oh my god i got a 50000 bill with google um from big query im going to help you avoid that um were also going to talk about how do you even navigate the platform because it looks kind of terrifying especially if youve worked really with the marketing side of google products when you go into google cloud console it is overwhelming and even i as a developer find it overwhelming um and then were going to talk about something i call aggregate tables now for any of my data scientists in the room i know that there are aggregate functions in big query its not the same uh this is what i call it um so again not an industry term dont tell your data scientists thats what theyre called because its not really but thats what i call them because it makes sense to me um if you do want the slides you can download them here uh theyre already up there uh so ill leave it here for two seconds and then theres another one at the end so all right so lets get started is bit query even worth it seems a little bit overwhelming sometimes especially when you first log in so lets talk about what is it just kidding i fixed it im never going to read that much to you guys i dont hate anyone that much um so really the important things here that this is saying is that it is a place to store your data you can store a ton of it you can query it really quickly and then its also an infrastructure that you dont have to manage all of that is already done for you and then the other piece i want to call it here is that you use sql to navigate it why is that important sql is old as dirt which means there is a ton of documentation on it there are a ton of tools to help you figure out how to use it um so theres just theres already a community of support to make it that much easier to interact with your data so what are the benefits um you get to scale its unsampled right if you uh you know weve been seeing about the api we actually start getting some of that data noah was calling out how you can see if its an anonymized query right we get all of that actually already in big query um if youre like me and you actually have to work across different platforms or maybe you have integrated campaigns with your clients youre logging into google ads and meta and linkedin and tik tok and reddit advertising and everything else in order to see your data a lot of those tools have availability for you to put that data in big query as well so it could potentially become the one source where your information where your data lives um and again you can do a lot of things and as far as access data back to day one once you turn on the integrations um were going to talk a little bit more but basically any of the calculations you do retroactively applies to any of the data you already have um so lets continue again so why doesnt everybody use it um this is the homepage for google cloud console which is how you get to big query um can you tell me where big query is yeah its its its and it moves on you its not great um so we also need to of course talk about the pricing because nobody wants prize bills and unfortunately when you read the pricing documentation for big query its like what the what that means nothing to me um so im going to tell you theres really two things two factors that decide how much your bill is going to be the first is storage so this is just how much data are you actually holding in big query uh the free tier actually gets you 10 gigs which doesnt sound like much but yall its basically like csvs so imagine 10 gigs of csvs that is a ton of data um i have enterprise clients that they will have anywhere from six to 8 million urls at a time depending on their inventory we are nowhere close the storage is fine storage is cheap and even if you were to extend past that storage is still cheap like to double that is like 15 cents a month so if youre paying a lot for storage uh youre getting screwed um and then after that is computation so this is where how much are you are you actually interacting with the data are you transforming it are you pulling it all that kind of good stuff uh the free tier gets you a terabyte which youre like oh that sounds like a lot unfortunately its not um so this is where things start to get really expensive um if youre not smart about how youre querying and interacting with your data so if you do find that cost are up theres probably some really inefficient queries um and anytime ive seen the horror stories of those i was not expecting this 5000 bill thats thats been whats happened um also to give you context i do i im fortunate my agency has a number of enterprise clients and we have set up these systems for them most of my clients are still under 10 a month and the reporting is coming from it were doing basically using only big query as our source for data and its still less than 10 bucks uh my agency we definitely dont even come close to ever having to pay anything cuz well were an agency website so you know it happens um so lets talk about the compute cost how does it how does it build up so this is a liquor studio report that we put together for ourselves actually and this single chart thats showing the branded impression share seems like a really simple chart right its things we do all the time well whats happening here is that single le query to build that report is having to look through and find specific keywords query the impressions for that um and then also organize it by date so theres already multiple functions happening here that seem really simple but start to add up really quickly so when youre going through this um you can create budget alerts so this is a way to make sure you dont get that surprise bill or at least you cant faint ign ignorance anymore i guess would be part of a bad part um so when youre going into google search console im sorry not search console cloud console im going to do that so many times um you can create a budget um im not going to walk you through all of the screenshots because youre tech seos which means youre probably really good at following documentation um but you can set all these up so ill just talk a few through a few things um when youre specifying your budget you can actually apply it to just specific organizations so if youre agency and you have different clients in there you can although i would highly recommend uh still make sure the clients credit card is on it just in case somebody on their side gets stupid and plays with stuff uh not that any of my clients would ever do that its happened um and then you can also limit it by project or even a service so if maybe your client does already have a google cloud console account or you do because youre doing other fun things with machine learning um you can just limit it based on whatever service youre running um this is really important if you if your organization does have an account and maybe your the app thats powering your service runs through here uh you dont want to limit what theyre doing but obviously you want to limit the cost youre causing um you can create alert thresholds you can make these emails as annoying as you want to and if you want to add the finance person on the email alerts um thats how you do it so again youll have the slides so you can look at this later um some of my favorite sample budgets um um google really likes to push last month spend thats the one its always going to default too uh my favorite is any i want to know if im spending anything um cuz even if theres one day where its like hey suddenly something costs 30 cents i want to know about it because a lot of times that could be a sign that a query started um and i want to make sure its not going to run multiple times that day or multiple times that month um and then again you can limit to the specific services and those are the services that you would limit it to okay so now weve talked about budgeting so lets actually get started and like do something with it how do we connect it so this has to be one of my favorite things that google ever gave us is the bulk export from gsc um its also the reason why my agency we actually used to work in snowflake or red shift for any kind of data storage that single thing kind of forced us to learn bigquery so i guess it was really smart of them i dont know um okay so when you start you do have to create a bilding account and youve probably already set up your budget if you dont do this part before you try to connect everything you will run into blockers you also will have different limitations so all you have to do is add a credit card it wont get charged um but i can say i think if you dont add a credit card then youre limited to like 11 projects once you add it you have up to 100 and you can always pay for more of course google will let you pay for more um so youre going to create a project now when thinking about projects think about how you want them to be separated well talk a little bit more about that and again im not going to walk you through all these things but you do have to enable the api the first time thats kind of an important piece um i talk about how to find that for gsc this one is kind of a pain in the butt uh you actually have to go through and add specific users that make no sense so its like this search console data export um i dont i i would never expect anyone to have that memorized so definitely look through the documentation you assign the types of jobs you want them to do and then now youre going to go into gsc into your settings and turn on the bulk data export the important part here uh if you forgot what your project id is when you need to fill it in uh this is how you find it back in cloud console and when you are setting your location dont it up um it is really hard to fix later so if i because were here im assuming probably most of us our data governance is based on us laws but if you are deal with gdpr um you need to put in whatevers there uh bigquery does a great job of making sure that your data stays compliant that the infrastructure is protected uh so thats thats why thats really important um and data set name so youll see that when it comes through so if you are combining multiple properties or maybe youre combining the different subfolders that serge was talking about um thats a great way that you can start differentiating but search conso is always going to be there okay once youve turned it on youll see this level bulk data export is active it takes 24 to 48 hours for the data to start coming through so unfortunately this is not one of those projects where you can totally forget to do it and then do it 15 minutes before youre meeting with your boss and be like see its here no its going to take a day sorry yall um and then youll start see it coming through looks like that so lets talk about g4 again create a project or you could use the same one it really just depends on what kind of organization works for you the things i like to consider is do i want to have separate budgets um and then also kind of the size across the different projects um im also just kind of a control freak so i separate everything but i realized not everybody wants to

and then the tables in big query for g4 look a little bit scarier but i promise its not too bad okay so now youve got all your dat pulling and youre like i should connect this to lior studio no please dont because again thats where you would start adding a lot of uh query or compute time you could find yourself uh really paying for a lot because if you connect uh lior studio to just those big query tables that is the raw data set thered be a lot of filtering going on all of the time so so dont do that not not just yet but okay so were not going to get there yet i promise we will but lets talk about how do we even get around bigquery so uh noah was actually talking about this that with uh the export there are two tables that come through you have either site or url impressions you all sell

completely free and i love free stuff because who doesnt um so with a query when you run it youll actually get your query results right in front of you okay so now we know how to work with the data so lets actually talk about the magic how am i going to make sure that you dont get charged a bunch of money which by the way if you screwed up and you get charged a bunch of money disclaimer i dont owe you anything i am a small business owner i have a kid hes really expensive um all right so the the process that were going to do with this is first youre going to use your measurement plan which shameless plug we have in fact written an entire article about how to create a measurement plan and we give away a template um and actually if you download the slides theres a link to all that the reason why i love measurement plans and something to know about me is just in general i love documentation because i dont want to have to remember things later because thats just too much work um so in a measurement plan what it should be doing is actually saying okay heres all the things im going to measure here are the things i actually care about um and one of my favorites is also heres how im tracking those things that becomes really useful when you know maybe andy from design decides to change all your buttons and he didnt ask you about it he just changed everything and now you cant track anything um thats a way that you can start diagnosing makes it much easier so definitely use a measurement plan thats going to help us identify what data we actually care about then were going to create some tables and then were going to set up a job so that that table updates every day as new data comes in from the bulk export and then those new tables are the ones that were going to connect to looker studio and well talk more about why okay so when it comes to decide what data you want again use your measurement plan um the first ones i always start with are these so i just want to see things by page by device by country all that good stuff um event data as well how do people enter my site based on what channels all that good stuff and i would say start small just build a few uh one of the reasons i love frontend development is because of the instant gratification right were able to code things and immediately see that its working uh so again let yourself have a few wins dont try to tackle everything at once you will drive yourself crazy and i guess were probably all a little bit crazy because were tech seos but lets try to slow the rooll as much as we can um and again also think about all of your data is in big query already well once you turn it on um so anything you collect after that if i the data im collecting now if i were to make a query next year its still going to go through my entire database because all of that data still lives there now obviously it cant make up data so if you have a problem of custom events arent tracking thats not going to fix it uh but anything thats already there youre going to be able to go back and retroactively c calculate so after that you now know what youre pulling you use one of the tools to write a sql query for you explorer not to be confused with noahs explorer from what two octobers um thats a big query calls their their preview paints um one of the things to note here when you go to write a query many times itll actually show you i know theres supposed to be a laser pointer on here i have no idea how to use it okay um itll actually tell you how much computation power itll take to run it so again thats where you can start getting an idea of this might be a really inefficient quer um which is also why when im testing i always add this limit thousand uh thats to give me an idea of is this actually the data that i want um so that im not wasting all my budget in playing around because i feel like tech seos thats what we love to do thats why we do what we do um all right so you you press the button run its really this is one of those times for googles trying to trick us um and then you get your results you can actually save them into a big qu table so youre going to go ahead and name that big query table whatever you want it to be i recommend not being super fun or creative with it so that you know what it is later uh so for example this one is just my sitewide queries and clicks so i just wanted to know what are all the queries that my site has and how many clicks and impressions is getting um and i have it by day actually all right so n its going to be my table that has worked through my entire data set thats already existing whether its been there for a week or data thats been there for a year we finally uh thats going to be kind of like what sets the base for that table so now im going to take that same exact query but im going to change it to only look for yesterdays date now if youre a really large site i would actually recommend doing two days before um and thats because the bulk export when it decides to do it can vary wildly um and then also if you are a site thats used to having to wait 48 hours to see your data in gsse anyways youre probably going to run into the same problem so maybe ill uh so for small sites again i would just do yesterday but for our larger brands we do two days ago um because what im going to do now is actually hit that schedule button so i mean im going to test the query to make sure it works but im going to schedule it and what im going to do is make sure that it appends to that table i created earlier so thats the table im going to use that sitewide queries and clicks thats the table im going to use to start generating my liquor studio reports why that calculation is only happening once per day if i wasnt if that looker studio report was still connecting to the raw data set that means every time someone loaded that liquor studio report those queries would be run literally every time and i dont know if you all have clients like ive had where you think honestly theyre theyre refreshing it all day i dont know what else they do then look at that um so or like weve also had clients where we set up realtime monitoring dashboards obviously this is not a use case where you can do that because were waiting on a delay from g4 and gsc theres really nothing we can do about that um or if there is i dont know it um but you know that would just be constantly refreshing you would absolutely see a big bill or possibly in liquor studio start getting your quota exceeded messaging which is not infuriating at all um and thats thats pretty much it i went really fast all right",

        "raw_text": "[Applause] cool thanks everyone uh yes so rolling your own rake tracking solution uh I'll just skip this uh you guys heard about me already um cool so what is the problem with most rank tracking Solutions today you run into the issue that pretty much you're you're locked into this this big platform with its own data um doesn't allow for a lot of customizability you need a you need a new feature um and you're sort of like locked into that you need to go to a different vendor if you need a different feature or you get them to create it which is unlikely um all the data exists in silos for the most part you are um you're getting ring tracking data you may like export it or dump that to a SQL database is and like maybe you want to do an analysis you're you're exporting it doing the analysis there it's not fully baked into the platform unless the the platform made it uh that that analysis ready available for you so there's some clear advantages to running your own rank tracking software like Ranken Berry so you get full data control um everything sits within one platform you all your data that you're going to use for analysis all the rank tracking data anything else that you're pulling in that you want to mix with that data it's all available all in one for you to use end to end um if some a feature doesn't exist you want that feature it's uh you can make it yourself um again you don't have to switch to a different data provider or a different rank tracking software you can go ahead and just add on that functionality if you need it um lastly Rank and Barry is an open-source project which means uh Beyond this being a oneman show um if you want to contribute and help others you're surely able to do that so to get started it's a like I said it's an open source project it's available on a GitHub repo feel free to clone that repo and run it yourself or contribute to it um whatever you want it's up to you um I'll just put this front first is uh right now it's running off of a rank tracking API called space serp which has this lifetime deal on appsumo it's started as the API first before I decided to build a rank tracker that's that's the Genesis of this I got a really good deal on a rank tracking API and I built software around it um but if you want to actually try the project you will need access to space serp first it's like 60 bucks for life it's not bad um cool so talking about the the architecture of rank and Berry oh before I do this um let me just say uh I had this really ambitious road map for Ranken Barry like I wanted to have all these features done before this conference and I didn't get to it uh so so what did I do I tried using some AI software I used cursor to try to build out features total nightmare um like it it made some features and it introduced tenfold the amount of bugs and I spent like two weeks trying to rectify the bugs before I decided to just revert and code most of it myself so you became a 10x program yeah 10 10x minus I don't know it was it was it was miserable but the one advantage it did have is it helped me generate these these architecture uh graphs uh so there's there's some purposes for for the AI software today um so how does how does Rank and Barry work so the the back end is written in Python uh using fast apis the the library uh the front end is uh vuejs view3 uh fast stand facilitates um reading and writing from you know three apis right now that being the rank tracking uh API that I mentioned space serp um grep Works grep words for search volume uh in Google search console API for some other data magic um and everything is dumped to a SQL database uh SQL light in this case um why use Python for rank tracking when it's not the fastest or uh necessarily the best uh because python has emerged as the language for data work it's primarily what machine learning Engineers use it's what data scientists use nowadays um except for like a small like offset of PE offshot of people that are still using like r or something like that or um baked into like a Java framework but data science pretty much R uh R some premium with python um which means that Rank and Barry is really well set up for the future data analysis work that you're ultimately going to want to do with this platform like I don't know anyone who does rank tracking and just like looks at the data and that's it like either you might report on it to some Executives but like you want ultimately want to do something with that data do just some sort of analysis and having python sort of like baked into that pipeline already is is a real advantage in my opinion okay so let's talk about fast API uh fast API again is is the library that powers the bulk of the back end um was the first time I had ever used Fast API so it was a it was a good experience I'd used things like flask and and Django in the past um and fast API really sort of builds itself more of as like for writing apis but it makes a really great backend uh for for various reasons um one it runs everything as as an endpoint which is really cool for for modularity um becomes the center for it um it manages things asynchronously so if you're using an asynchronous front end framework like a react or a view you might as well have your backend run asynchronously um and it's just a really fun coding experience honestly I I really like how you define like end points and the functions that serve under each of those end points um SQL light uh for local storage honestly this is not the best solution um it's really great for when I was doing development work and running everything locally but ultimately Rank and Barry is going to need to move past that to something like postgress uh when we want to handle like multi-user work so that's that's something to be upgraded um mentioned this already so external apis that it's pulling in from is that space serp API for rank tracking data um Google search console which is pulling in stuff like clicks and Impressions and click through it GP wordss for search volume and just as uh fast API is serving up the endpoints it's helping facilitate the the ingestion of data as well so um I'll just mention this quickly one of the really nice advantages and this isn't sort of built in yet is with fast API is that it automatically generates API documents um so if you build your application around fast API if you go to the API endpoint and just append slash docs to it it will uh it will generate robust API documentation so all you have to do once this is like a in multi-user mode is do some like API key management and you've you've given your clients or the people that are working with you a fully functional API built on top of your rank tracking platform um okay let's let's talk about front end for a bit I mentioned this um vuejs is a a modern front-end JavaScript framework much like a react I've been a big fan of Vue for for a while now I think it's starting to gain more traction nowadays um but that remains to be seen uh so just in terms of the the the construction we have VJs which runs with vew router that handles the routing so the different URLs that it creates um and of course with most modern JavaScript Frameworks those different routes are making use of various uh components um that can be used sort of for to modular create Pages um and that's all communicating via the pus store uh which I'll get back to uh and the various API services and eventually back to fast API for the back end um instead of trying for me to sell you on view uh well let me I'm going to let view sell you on view um play Under the Hood view has a refined reactivity system combined with declarative rendering this means Vue does a lot of the heavy lifting for you because Vue is a progressive framework you can start with the Cor library and add on the pieces you need from its interconnected ecosystem featuring its own router State Management Solutions testing utilities a CLI and more Vue is designed to parallel with other popular Technologies like typescript giving you and your team the flexibility to use view how it best fits your workflow its fine-tune design prevents your components from over rendering keeping your app performant as it skills instead of having to manually optimize your code view takes your codee and intelligently op optimizes it for you as it compiles so you'll render fast and stay fast VI gives you back the freedom to focus on getting creative and staying productive enjoying the development process Again by choosing view you're investing in a technology that is invested in You by choosing Rank and bearing you're investing in technology that's invested in you um so one of the things I really like about Vue is it's like a progressive framework so you can start very very small um you can literally like embed a line of uh JavaScript from like a CDN and make a very very small application without dealing with like the terminal at all or you can scale that up and build a very large application like Rank and Berry and pull in like different uh more advanced components to to view um so learning curve wise it's it's really phenomenal um I feel like no one talks about these little things when they they give presentations so I might be fun to touch on things like v um so V is sort of the the this alternative to like a a web pack or something like that um and it it handles uh the bundling of all the JavaScript um so you get really like efficient code running um but it actually skips the bundling when you're in development mode so you can do development work a little bit faster um also has something called hot module replacement or HMR uh so if you make like a small changement to that code it just loads that code instead of the entire script again speed um and when it's time to put the the JavaScript into production it bundles it just as like a web pack would um and modern at least in view3 Pia is the go-to uh State Management for Java for view um so you can sort of think about this as like a centralized way of like handling a lot of like the more complex JavaScript code um instead of each like component handling individual like functions uh Pia will handle that for you so when a application starts to get more complex you you'll probably want to introduce something like Pia and that's what rank and Barry did um and it plays very well with v which we just talked about okay so enough about how it functions let's talk about the actual functionality of rank and Barry itself um this is sort of like the main view of rank and Barry if you're thinking about running it yourself you have this this rank table it shows you the date for which the data was pulled in the keyword the the project or domain the rank that pulled got pulled in from space serp um an estimated business impact which I'll come back to search volume rank change since you pulled in the data GSC data so on and so forth we have scheduling and On Demand fetches so you can choose uh whenever you want to just like fetch new ranking data from space serp or you can schedule it to you know pull hourly or daily or monthly however you much you want um and that's handled oh I'll come back um has a tag management system so you can look at a subset of your data whether that's across multiple projects or within a single project um um and it provides summary data by those domain SL project or tag um and it also generates a really neat share of voice data across the Ser so what does that look like uh so this is the scheduling functionality you select the frequency the the project that it's applicable to and the tag and you you just schedule it um and I should say that's all handled synchronously um so it's not blocking the main application so you can continue to like browse the data without you know getting Frozen um and unable to use it how you apply tags this is the the summary data uh for a particular tag for a different rate different various date range um and this is the the share of voice view you can see there's a there's a Time series data where you can see the top 10 results and then uh a little dut chart below that so you can see how the distribution looks and below that there's actually a table uh with the different percentages Google search console um so it's going to ingest Google search console for the keywords that you're ranking for that you're pulling in rank data for which actually enables things like a business impact analysis so it's all fun and good rank goes up that that sounds good uh rank goes down that sounds bad um but what is that actually mean in terms of like Revenue in terms of like business value uh I want to know what that is is uh so the business impact analysis helps you calculate that um so it it gives it calculates an Aver the the clickthrough rate for each position using Google search console data so you know what your actual click-through rate curve is um for your website um and you can give it like an average conversion rate um and conversion rate value so it will actually calculate if my website went down a certain amount like what is the actual impact on Revenue um time series use um pulling in top 100 results for all the keywords um which isn't totally useful right now but will become more useful as we add more features so it's a little bit forward thinking so here's here's an example of the estimated impact um you can see that's like the two three the fifth column with the the dollar amount so here we have the rank change went up 23 positions so that added $245 of revenue for my website and that's how you just simply you're going to authenticate with Google search console it will start ingesting it you'll dictate um the conversion rates and whatnot in in the configuration and it'll start producing that data um this is the time series data so you can see what things look like over time also super important is uh when you do these sort of time ser series charts to make sure if there are gaps in your data to not like continue the line you want to actually see those gaps so it's not misleading so it does that pretty well top 100 results um and it you can't see it on the screen but it pulls in like stuff like the The Meta descriptions that are shown in the ser and whatnot okay so let's take a break uh for a second and talk about some challenges and limitations of rank and Berry today so we've talked about this a few times but it's relying on this API called space serp right now space serp is really really cheap um but it's certainly not the best rank tracking API out there um has no features like what are the featured Snippets or AI overviews or general serp features it's really not ingesting any of that data um and it's a it's a single API provider there right now the ring and Berry is only set up to use space serp and we hope to change that in the future so people have uh have different options so yeah we'll introduce other API providers um used to use Sur API over at Shopify it's great and you know i' I've heard a lot of people ask about serper and and value Ser which has like pay as you go pricing and people really like that um so that's that's definitely on the road map um and we talked about SQL light being a limitation um so SQL light produces a flat file in your directory it's not the most secure it's not really set up for multiple users um well um so we're going to want to move off of of SQL light eventually into something like postgress um right now like I said there was a bunch of features I wanted to get to um but as like a solo Creator who has another job like that didn't happen so the open source architecture is is really important like you know people contributing to it can can definitely make it better um and another limitation depends on how you look at it is um there there's no Google data studio built into this so any sort of like chart custom Customs is a is a manual effort all right talk about open source and scaling so yeah it's it's just me um every bug I squash is uh you know like another week um so open source really helps uh submit bug reports and feature requests into the GitHub repo that'll really help hecka you know create your own branch and do a polar Quest um and hopefully we'll create a self-sustaining Community um I feel like people don't talk about about licensing when they talk about open source enough um that's that's a really important part of Open Source um so I went with ag GPL 3 um which they consider a strong copyleft license um basically what this says is you you can it's an open source project you can customize it use it however you want you can run a commercial product off of it but by law you have to link back to the source code so that helps reinforce that if that it is an open source project that the development is dependent on others so even if you're you're people are paying for it um off of an instance that they ran themselves like you should be contributing back to the project um now I'm going to talk through all the features that I expected to have done that I didn't have done in time um and I I blame AI for that um it it under promised over promised um algorithm update overlays so you have click data from Google search console you have ranking data um why not layer in if there was a Google update um Google has ad Json endpoint that has all the algorithm updates listed out when they started when they ended so you should be able to Overlay that data and see you know is your ranking decline due to an algorithm update or are you just really bad at SEO um and the same thing anomaly detection um we you can do something very simple with like a zcore um if something falls out of like the zcore bound like you know maybe that's due to like an algorithm update because like Google's changing things and things are like going up and down a whole bunch and um or maybe it's just very like intermittent rank change and like it's going to correct itself the next day so knowing whether that something is an anomaly or like the status quo is really really helpful we already have the data on this so we might as well implement it um forecasting so you can you we can since we're using python it's very easy to integrate something like Facebook profit which facilitates um you know time series forecasting and projections very easily um so you can have an idea of based on your historic data did will my data continue to go up or down and by what magnitude um keyword clustering so we we talked about the importance for future work of having the full 100 results ingested into Rank and Berry um and that's because it's really really good way to handle keyword clustering um there's a bunch of different methods that look of at basically the crossover of URLs between keywords um look at the URLs where you like actually injust the keywords and look at the the Thematic contents of that um and sort of assess how keywords should be grouped together by topic rather than um individual keywords and that also enables really fantastic analysis um we talked about this going to have to move to postgress um we're also going to need authentication right now this is running locally and there's absolutely no sense of users or authentication this is not set up for a commercial application currently that's that's got to change sooner rather than later and that's it that's that's uh that's Frankenberry um you know I would love for you to try it out and contribute to it feel free to you know clone the root repo and uh give it a try thank you",

rendering keeping your app performant as it skills instead of having to manually optimize your code view takes your codee and intelligently op optimizes it for you as it compiles so youll render fast and stay fast vi gives you back the freedom to focus on getting creative and staying productive enjoying the development process again by choosing view youre investing in a technology that is invested in you by choosing rank and bearing youre investing in technology thats invested in you um so one of the things i really like about vue is its like a progressive framework so you can start very very small um you can literally like embed a line of uh javascript from like a cdn and make a very very small application without dealing with like the terminal at all or you can scale that up and build a very large application like rank and berry and pull in like different uh more advanced components to to view um so learning curve wise its its really phenomenal um i feel like no one talks about these little things when they they give presentations so i might be fun to touch on things like v um so v is sort of the the this alternative to like a a web pack or something like that um and it it handles uh the bundling of all the javascript um so you get really like efficient code running um but it actually skips the bundling when youre in development mode so you can do development work a little bit faster um also has something called hot module replacement or hmr uh so if you make like a small changement to that code it just loads that code instead of the entire script again speed um and when its time to put the the javascript into production it bundles it just as like a web pack would um and modern at least in view3 pia is the goto uh state management for java for view um so you can sort of think about this as like a centralized way of like handling a lot of like the more complex javascript code um instead of each like component handling individual like functions uh pia will handle that for you so when a application starts to get more complex you youll probably want to introduce something like pia and thats what rank and barry did um and it plays very well with v which we just talked about okay so enough about how it functions lets talk about the actual functionality of rank and barry itself um this is sort of like the main view of rank and barry if youre thinking about running it yourself you have this this rank table it shows you the date for which the data was pulled in the keyword the the project or domain the rank that pulled got pulled in from space serp um an estimated business impact which ill come back to search volume rank change since you pulled in the data gsc data so on and so forth we have scheduling and on demand fetches so you can choose uh whenever you want to just like fetch new ranking data from space serp or you can schedule it to you know pull hourly or daily or monthly however you much you want um and thats handled oh ill come back um has a tag management system so you can look at a subset of your data whether thats across multiple projects or within a single project um um and it provides summary data by those domain sl project or tag um and it also generates a really neat share of voice data across the ser so what does that look like uh so this is the scheduling functionality you select the frequency the the project that its applicable to and the tag and you you just schedule it um and i should say thats all handled synchronously um so its not blocking the main application so you can continue to like browse the data without you know getting frozen um and unable to use it how you apply tags this is the the summary data uh for a particular tag for a different rate different various date range um and this is the the share of voice view you can see theres a theres a time series data where you can see the top 10 results and then uh a little dut chart below that so you can see how the distribution looks and below that theres actually a table uh with the different percentages google search console um so its going to ingest google search console for the keywords that youre ranking for that youre pulling in rank data for which actually enables things like a business impact analysis so its all fun and good rank goes up that that sounds good uh rank goes down that sounds bad um but what is that actually mean in terms of like revenue in terms of like business value uh i want to know what that is is uh so the business impact analysis helps you calculate that um so it it gives it calculates an aver the the clickthrough rate for each position using google search console data so you know what your actual clickthrough rate curve is um for your website um and you can give it like an average conversion rate um and conversion rate value so it will actually calculate if my website went down a certain amount like what is the actual impact on revenue um time series use um pulling in top 100 results for all the keywords um which isnt totally useful right now but will become more useful as we add more features so its a little bit forward thinking so heres heres an example of the estimated impact um you can see thats like the two three the fifth column with the the dollar amount so here we have the rank change went up 23 positions so that added 245 of revenue for my website and thats how you just simply youre going to authenticate with google search console it will start ingesting it youll dictate um the conversion rates and whatnot in in the configuration and itll start producing that data um this is the time series data so you can see what things look like over time also super important is uh when you do these sort of time ser series charts to make sure if there are gaps in your data to not like continue the line you want to actually see those gaps so its not misleading so it does that pretty well top 100 results um and it you cant see it on the screen but it pulls in like stuff like the the meta descriptions that are shown in the ser and whatnot okay so lets take a break uh for a second and talk about some challenges and limitations of rank and berry today so weve talked about this a few times but its relying on this api called space serp right now space serp is really really cheap um but its certainly not the best rank tracking api out there um has no features like what are the featured snippets or ai overviews or general serp features its really not ingesting any of that data um and its a its a single api provider there right now the ring and berry is only set up to use space serp and we hope to change that in the future so people have uh have different options so yeah well introduce other api providers um used to use sur api over at shopify its great and you know i ive heard a lot of people ask about serper and and value ser which has like pay as you go pricing and people really like that um so thats thats definitely on the road map um and we talked about sql light being a limitation um so sql light produces a flat file in your directory its not the most secure its not really set up for multiple users um well um so were going to want to move off of of sql light eventually into something like postgress um right now like i said there was a bunch of features i wanted to get to um but as like a solo creator who has another job like that didnt happen so the open source architecture is is really important like you know people contributing to it can can definitely make it better um and another limitation depends on how you look at it is um there theres no google data studio built into this so any sort of like chart custom customs is a is a manual effort all right talk about open source and scaling so yeah its its just me um every bug i squash is uh you know like another week um so open source really helps uh submit bug reports and feature requests into the github repo thatll really help hecka you know create your own branch and do a polar quest um and hopefully well create a selfsustaining community um i feel like people dont talk about about licensing when they talk about open source enough um thats thats a really important part of open source um so i went with ag gpl 3 um which they consider a strong copyleft license um basically what this says is you you can its an open source project you can customize it use it however you want you can run a commercial product off of it but by law you have to link back to the source code so that helps reinforce that if that it is an open source project that the development is dependent on others so even if youre youre people are paying for it um off of an instance that they ran themselves like you should be contributing back to the project um now im going to talk through all the features that i expected to have done that i didnt have done in time um and i i blame ai for that um it it under promised over promised um algorithm update overlays so you have click data from google search console you have ranking data um why not layer in if there was a google update um google has ad json endpoint that has all the algorithm updates listed out when they started when they ended so you should be able to overlay that data and see you know is your ranking decline due to an algorithm update or are you just really bad at seo um and the same thing anomaly detection um we you can do something very simple with like a zcore um if something falls out of like the zcore bound like you know maybe thats due to like an algorithm update because like googles changing things and things are like going up and down a whole bunch and um or maybe its just very like intermittent rank change and like its going to correct itself the next day so knowing whether that something is an anomaly or like the status quo is really really helpful we already have the data on this so we might as well implement it um forecasting so you can you we can since were using python its very easy to integrate something like facebook profit which facilitates um you know time series forecasting and projections very easily um so you can have an idea of based on your historic data did will my data continue to go up or down and by what magnitude um keyword clustering so we we talked about the importance for future work of having the full 100 results ingested into rank and berry um and thats because its really really good way to handle keyword clustering um theres a bunch of different methods that look of at basically the crossover of urls between keywords um look at the urls where you like actually injust the keywords and look at the the thematic contents of that um and sort of assess how keywords should be grouped together by topic rather than um individual keywords and that also enables really fantastic analysis um we talked about this going to have to move to postgress um were also going to need authentication right now this is running locally and theres absolutely no sense of users or authentication this is not set up for a commercial application currently thats thats got to change sooner rather than later and thats it thats thats uh thats frankenberry um you know i would love for you to try it out and contribute to it feel free to you know clone the root repo and uh give it a try thank you",

        "raw_text": "thank you who's ready for a journey most of my decks are kind of Journey decks I take you along for the ride uh we're going to explore uh what I learned building a tool right so the bulk data export is something that I got super stoked on a year and a half ago because I was part of the small team that developed that tool with Google um they they got a lot of insight from a small group of seos to help them develop the tool I hadn't really worked with it a lot and I've always had it in the back of my mind as something that I wanted to explore and work with more deeply and I also had built a product called Branch Explorer which uses Google search console data coming out of the API and it had some limitations because it was only working with at the Web search type and it was only Gathering 50,000 rows of data per day and I always wanted to take Branch Explorer and marry it together with with this this Pipeline and so what I wanted to do why is I know I gave him the right file uh that's the best thing that's ever happened uh so uh what I wanted to do was to marry the two together and I wanted to build a really badass tool that LE see the thing that's cool about the bulk data export pipeline is that Google handles all the engineering for you they push all the data for you up into the cloud and that makes it super easy from an engineering perspective and I wanted to utilize that data and push it into Branch Explorer which is a custom view of data and what y'all are going to get out of this is actually your own free Branch Explorer tool and your own data pipelines that you can use yourselves to look at search console data at scale super badass right and I love kangaroos that's not my slide uh someone asked me why it's hard I can't believe this I'm being broadcast to YouTube uh uh so I just want to say hi to Joy Hawkins who's probably watching this right now and I'm hoping that Marie Haynes is also watching this because she gets a wicked call out and I also want to take an opportunity here to have you guys take some notes this next piece is not part of my deck but I want you to write down these three words as the most important thing you're going to learn at this conference make me smarter I want all of us to embrace those three words of as we make our way throughout the world there have been plenty times today and yesterday where I've been completely blown away by what I'm seeing on stage and I felt less than not as smart as not as experienced as has anyone felt that way we're all on a journey together right and this is my knowledge right and when I watched Kristen tinsky talk today I was feeling like oh my God like her knowledge is so much bigger than mine but the thing is that for all of us all of our sets of knowledge are tangential and overlapping so like just keep in mind as you're making a way and as you're on your journey learning all of this stuff like if your boss sent you here to learn Tech SEO in a conference right like it's really hard to learn all this stuff and you just have to commit yourself to the journey of learning while they figure it out can I ask you a couple questions please do so you also have a SEO Community which I forgot to mention yeah how would you recommend people getting involved in that okay so the tech excuse me the seoc community.com right it's if you go to that website you'll see that there's a page called apply and you apply with your name email and your link D profile that helps us vet that you're a real human being which is kind of important there are about 3,200 other marketers a lot of folks who are here are members and moderators Mike's a moderator of our testing Channel Kristen's a moderator of our AI uh AI for SEO Channel and I think it's an amazing Place uh I took a huge amount of um inspiration for what AR did with women and Tech SEO and I just thought that um when Twitter fell apart I really wanted to not have to look for my friends right like I didn't want to do Mastadon I didn't want to do blue sky I didn't know where to look and slack just felt like the smartest way to go Okay and like I said you've done so many videos with agency automats and so on and there's people in here when we talk about automation it's like it's cool but they don't know where to start and I know you're going to talk about that to some degree here yeah but if you're someone coming into this for the first time yeah where would you recommend that they start uh appscript Google Sheets functions to appscript to JavaScript or you could take an alternate path which goes appscript to python uh python is a much easier language to learn the JavaScript who's afraid of learning python anyone does it sound hard does it sound like only smart people do it it is literally the easiest programming language to learn period like the things that are hard about it are like managing indentations like how many spaces do I put right and then also getting packages to work together yeah of course of course but from my perspective anyone can code now because of large language models right you as long as you can describe what you want it's going to give you some okay code and if it breaks then you just put the error in and then it fixes it yeah except for like and I'm going to get into that in the deck but like I basically built I built a data Pipeline and I only used AI to build it and I wanted to know if it was possible to build software applications just using do you guys want my laptop we got it okay um I don't believe you I think they Del I think they deleted my deck I think they by accident deleted it um but yeah like what I found was that when I built something that was creating JavaScript it was throwing natural language into the code so instead of like doing end end to equal a and b it would say a and then the word and and B and I was just feeling and I threw that into itself to fix it and it couldn't figure out the error that was that was um chat that was that was claw no that was uh chat GPT 4.0 so people think that Claude Sonet is like the best one for writing code I enjoy it a lot and I use it with cursor and I use it with another tool called ader Aid D eer we're going to talk about that as we go um this is the first time I've ever had a deck completely disappear it's there it's the combination of Adobe PDFs and Google Slides huh window and windows also oh Windows yeah yeah have we solved the problem though all right cool I could [Laughter] tell how you doing no I'm good I'm having fun yeah you know I actually like when things go wrong cuz it's like you get the opportunity to see what you can do in the moment so I think we're good now though so I'm I'm going to try this again everybody make some noise for noer y' this is amazing okay so we're going to go in on a journey I'm going to share all kinds of stuff that I learned building a really cool tool that you guys will get access to for free I'm going to share a ton of Lessons Learned I'm also going to share a couple custom gpts that I built for you keep in mind all of the slides are available to you so you're going to have them all after so you don't have to like race cuz I have a whole bunch of QR codes that are flashing up on screen but you can scan them you know when you get back to back wherever you're going okay so what's the mashup we're building something with the GSC bulk export and we're building something with Explorer Explorer is a looker Studio based product that we built that allows you to look at search console data at scale it's got all kinds of Time series visual ations tables it'll allow you to see stuff that you haven't seen before and we only Built it with this mashup using AI who knows Dave sodano I saw him speak at Tech SEO boost in 2019 and uh he blew me away and he blew me away because he was like the guy on stage talking about JavaScript and I think he even dropped the words python in his deck which I thought was amazing and he's been a hero of mine a mentor collaborator for a super long time so when I got the opportunity to speak here we had a call together and I said hey Dave I'm thinking about building this thing what do you think and he said oh dude it's awesome it's amazing you should totally do it everybody's going to eat it up it's going to be so cool and then he said this within six months this was two months ago I promise you anyone can build anything with an llm um let's see if he's right and when he said that I thought he was totally crazy because if you think about the technology adoption curve it looks a lot like this I feel like this is Kristen people like Kristen this is me this is a whole bunch of us in the room this is generalist folk doing marketing these are consumers these are our parents right okay and so when Dave said anyone could build anything I thought he was saying that this person could build something within 6 months and that's why I thought he was so super crazy okay and what do we know about the bulk export what is it well it's basically three things there's three tables that get pushed up into big query the first one's called the export log second one is the URL impression table third one is the site level data sight level data is where it's just aggregating all the me metrics for you at the query level the URL impression table is aggregating everything at the combination of query and page and it's giving you all kinds of other stuff too which we'll get into um these are the kinds of fields that are available inside the bulk export again you're going to get access to this in the slide this is coming straight out of big query if you haven't seen this before it's pretty cool specifically that field is anonymized query everybody's always super pissed about what gets sampled right this gives you the visibility to be able to see which pages are getting anonymized queries when I looked at our own data what I saw was that all of the content that we were building about how to use Google uh user interfaces how to use Google products those pages had ridiculous quantities of anonymized queries it was almost like Google didn't want us to know how to compete with them in the serers was how I was thinking about it but also look at all these Boolean Fields we've got is it a top stories is it a Blue Link is it a job listing job de details is it an action is it an events listing is it is it an amp is it video is it organic shopping who does e-commerce who would like to have that level of visibility about their data right so these are the kinds of things that are available to you when you start working with the bulk export um you've probably heard that it's expensive right tons of data it's really expensive we'll get into that um as getting ready for the build of this I didn't work with the site impression table at all I just didn't have enough time to do it um we've already talked about all of the volume of data but this is why there's so much you get data for all countries so all your data is segregated by country it's segregated by all of the devices it's segregated by all of the search types it's segregated by all the search appearances which were those Boolean fields that I shared in the last slide um it's also giving you information about Anonymous queries and there's no row limits let's say you're CNN.com or your Reddit uh you have it's no longer 50,000 rows per day it's as much as you want the fire hose is wide open so for Enterprise sites it's super super interesting what about a small site is it interesting then too yes and we'll get into that okay so all search types so we get discover Google news we get news we get image type we get video we get web super dope and I was also super stoked to build this because I felt like there just weren't any tools that I was aware of that's why I have the bracket around the many piece there just weren't a lot of tools for specifically looking at data that was coming out of the bulk export and um with Explorer these are the types of things that we do on top of the data coming out of search console to make it a lot easier to work with so we have like your position with the bulk export they're giving you position as a sum they're not giving it to you as an average position which is super annoying you have to do the math yourself to calculate you know the sum of position by the number of Impressions to get to an average position um so we do that math for you uh click-through rate full path which is is giving you almost like the Google analytics view of your url um we're also breaking it up into subdirectory so we're giving you insights as uh subdirectory level one 2 3 4 so if you have a site that has a whole bunch of structure you're going to really dig it um we're also giving you all kinds of information around funnel stages and the thing that I think you're going to really dig is you can set the Search terms in the tool that we give you that align with your different funnel stages which is super badass uh let's see so you can see brand versus non-brand funnel stage you can see if a URL um happens to be something that has UTM parameters that align with GBP stuff which is super useful and you can build URL segments has anyone ever used Bodify so in Bodify you've got a pretty cool way of doing segmentation of your else using whatever pattern you want I'm not positive but I think they do it with a case statement and what that means is that a page can be a or it can be B but it can't be both boom we can do we can have Pages be both so a page could be a Nike page because it has Nike in the URL and it could be a product detail page because it has product in the string and it could be a specific collection because it has shoes in it right so you can have one page be all kinds of different segments which is pretty rad the other thing that allows you to do is to see directories pages and queries that are driving change on our website I'm not telling you how cool this is because there's so much data it's not about the volume of data it's about having a tool that can help you get efficiently from the hyack down to the needle and that's why I've always been super jacked about Explorer because I felt like it was the best tool that I'd seen that enabled me to do it and because the data is all in big query if you've ever used looker studio and if you use native connectors and you're like this sucks it's super slow especially if you have to blend data together you're going to love using it because of how fast it is okay so I'm going to build something with AI what could possibly go wrong right has anyone ever struggled with chat GPT okay so here's my approach to building tools I've learned a lot talking to a lot of folks in the room about how to do stuff I generally focus on this sweet spot in the VIN diagram I'm looking for stuff that's fast to build easy to code and super cheap to own hopefully free so I build on the Google Cloud infrastructure generally um I always focus on painkillers not vitamins any aspiring product people in the room and you've ever thought to yourself like hey it'd be really cool if I could show blah blah blah that's a vitamin A painkiller is how do I save 100 hours for my agency this month right like that's the stuff that I always focus on they also help us as an agency smooth out capacity challenges as we grow in scale this helps us kind of deal with those capacity changes um last year we had a whole bunch of folks that went out on paternity and maternity to leave we found that all the automations that we put in Place helped us deal with that really really well they also help us be really really sticky with our clients when we can solve problems for our clients in ways that other people can't we've got a huge leg up and I don't know if you've heard about Sterling sky but we're in the local space and we're generally known as kind of the Premier local agency in North America uh this is the stack that I use I started with Google app script I was talking with whoops I was talking with Mike about that how do you go backwards it's not going backwards okay um I started with Google app script and then from there I actually had an agency automator with Dave sodano where he taught me how to do Cloud functions and I thought it was the coolest thing because Cloud functions allow you to have a million invocations for free per month I was like holy that's such a big number like I can do so many cool things with that and I work with apis I also use use um fir store specifically to manage State and that's like storing client variables storing information that I need to read and write a lot and I also use big query like crazy and looker studio for visualization to me if you're trying to figure out what your Tech stack should look like I think this is a great place to start you could totally you could totally um get rid of firestore and use postgress um as another database tech there but I think this is a great great way to think about things when I used to build I built exclusively in vs code for two to four years and when co-pilot came out I was super super jacked when you're thinking about Automation and you're thinking about AI in coding co-pilot is the best way to dip your toes in and the reason why is that when you're working with co-pilot it's basically like you'll start typing and it'll finish the line of code for it you hit Tab and you just move on and so it's not like chat GPT where you're like saying hey build me a whole function that does X and it spits out 400 lines of code and you have no idea what's broken this gives you like a very limited way to get started um I loved it I loved it I loved it I loved it um and then I went to Canada and I met Marie Haynes in person I don't know if you've ever spent any time with her but I had one of the most compelling come to Jesus talks I've ever had with any human ever where she told me I was doing everything wrong and all I needed to do in life was learn more about Ai and use it and I was like you Marie and I went home all angry and I made some changes uh I started to use chat GPT at that point this was in October of last year and I started learning about all the things that have to do with this stuff okay tokens a token is a chunk of words or images or text it's really small it's like four characters um in English each token is like 3/4 of a word right context window you're going to hear this all the time a context window is this is basically a measurement of the size of information that can go in and out of a large language model and as these technologies have improved context Windows have become larger so when you build things that super important because it goes from hey I can build you a line of code like co-pilot to hey you can have your entire code repository inside that context window so the llm knows everything about what you've built and what you're trying to build and with open AI chat GPT what what we found was that the context window was 8,000 tokens sounds like a lot right it's like 500 words or 500 no no no no it's it's 6,000 Words which is a lot so I built a whole bunch of custom gpts the first one that I built is probably the most useful if you like to code and you want something super useful and you work in the Google Cloud stack I strongly recommend if you want a GPT to use this one is the I love stackbot I use this almost every day in my work now um it allowed me to go from single line to building complete functions um and I thought it was super cool so I kept going and I built um a WordPress custom GPT I didn't know anything about building anything in WordPress believe it or not and this tool allowed me to build short codes it allowed me to build plugins it it helped me build all kinds of stuff I even built this plugin called the custom taxonomy grid block has anyone ever built something with categories and you hate the standard layout and it's awful this thing in two days I figured out how to build one I built an appscript GPT which is awesome because I love appscript if you're and anyone who's wanting to learn like I said earlier like appscript is the easiest thing to learn other than python it's super well documented it integrates with all kinds of Google tools including Google Sheets if you're trying to figure out the first step to building cool useful stuff for the agency the superpower do would be appscript plus Google Sheets okay then I learned about Claud Sonet 3.5 which is super cool super powerful huge context window 25 times larger than chat GPT I was like oh my God I'm in uh I pay for the Pro Plan it's 20 bucks a month strongly recommend you do it um I got super excited about it because it has this feature called artifacts and projects which I heard as custom you know doing the same kind of thing as a custom GPT um I don't know I'm not super into it I mean this was my take on it the way it works is you have to manually upload your files into into the tool and I just felt like that whole process was super annoying super slow and I just felt like it was a total pain in the ass and the reason why I didn't really dig it is it stopped me from doing the work it stopped me from doing iterations and speed of iteration is really really really the key for me anyway um I've learned so much from everybody else here and they all work differently but this was as I was learning to work with the tools this was one of my big takeaways I'd heard of this tool called cursor from a guy named Eric Woo and I jumped in with both feet it's super easy if you use vs code to move over to cursor you basically just export your settings out of vs code and import them into cursor it takes 2 minutes what's cool about it is it's basically vs code but it has AI built right into the tool there's a free plan and a Pro Plan free limits how many different AI queries you can do per day the Pro Plan is 20 bucks a month totally sign me up all day long for that I think it's just the coolest thing because it's using Claud Sonet as its built-in model it's got this huge context window so it knows a ton about your code I'm going to share some takeaways from doing this whole build you're like Hey where's the tool where's the tool we'll get to that at the end but I just wanted to share some of the lessons that I've learned um and I again like when I watched Christen talk like I was feeling impostor syndrome in a huge way but I think these are good best practices to get started I think with when you're working with AI and you're working with llms you're trying to code and build stuff do not say hey I want to build this thing thing and do this describe what you're trying to do in the broadest terms possible describe what your end goals are and then get the llm to reframe back to you what you're trying to accomplish what you're going to find is that when it summarizes that goal it's either going to know it's going to say something that aligns with how you think or it's going to be wrong and if it's wrong you're going to iter iteratively communicate with it back and forth until you get the goal right and then what you're going to find is that it's the time to then ask it to produce an architecture of the thing that you're trying to build and again it iteratively talk with it to get make sure that you have that all done and then what you're going to do is ask the model to build what's called pseudo code which to me is just like it talking about the code and describing it to you and if you know what you're looking at and you and you then sort of look at the code you'll know if they're on the right track or not I have not done all of the cycles of frustration yet we haven't gotten there um we're still trying to get it to get the context right and understand what it's trying to produce if you get the pseudo code right you then ask it to actually code and then you've basically gotten about 70% of the way there and the last 30% 20% 10% is the most frustrating part of the experience when I was building the tool that you guys are going to get I was trying to get it to create a data pipeline using only SQL and the reason I was trying to do that was that I had a pretty complex architecture beforehand I had Cloud functions and task cues and all kinds of infrastructure to support well Google was already pushing all the data for me up into the cloud and I was like why can't I just do this with SQL what I found was that that last 20 to 30% was brutal it was like 20 hours of going back and forth and back and forth okay other Lessons Learned doing the build with the bulk export the epoch version field uh table the epoch version field in the export log is really really really interesting I'd never really thought about this before but the epoch version basically tells you what what version of the data is up in the table so let's say Google puts data up in the table on day one and then they're like oh we have data quality issues and they have to fix it and put it back up as Epoch version number one that's really important that told me oh my God I need that that my data is not immutable when you hear about an API you might hear it described as mutable which means the data changes that's like Facebook data or ads conversion data this told me that I had to pay attention to that which I thought was really interesting um bulk export data costs let's get into this because this is super super interesting when you go to the tools web page there's going to be a calculator at the bottom of the page that's going to help you think through this basically what you're going to do is look at the data that's in your table and then divide it by the number of partitions that that basically tells you how many megabytes or gigabytes of data are going up into big query every single day and that's going to help you calculate how much the budget is and yeah I did use AI to build that tool on the web page too which was pretty cool um here's a major downside of the bulk export there is no back fill it's just like uh GA data also what you're going to find is that Dave was wrong Dave was WR it's not something that I perceive anyway that in 4 months is going to be something that all of us can just go build stuff like I I build things for a living that's my job I'm like the director of innovation for Sterling sky and I found that it was hard I found that it was really frustrating and I found that almost that co-pilot way of working was an easier way intellectually um to work I could get stuff done probably fast and understanding the wide world of possibilities that's I think the sweet spot for AI but like getting it done efficiently it was just such a frustrating build um and when I talk about early adopters really it's like a tolerance for pain and I feel like you had to have just an enormous tolerance for pain to kind of work with it that was that was my piece and you and you really have to be um ready to deal with risk okay also um just to give you all kinds of other insights like models create all kinds of trash outputs like that was that was a key piece I wanted to build my deck with AI too after I'd already built the tool I was like hey let's let's just build all my slides I think this would be super fun if you want to see how a AI goes wrong by the way if you want to see how to build slides with it but this this is the input like hey I want to build a 16x9 slide because that's what Google slides are right and I want it to look um I want it to have like a cool geometric pattern blah blah blah this is what it came out with I just wanted a freaking slide that said building software is hard right 10 iterations later and then it and then it throws an error at me it's it's like you're generating images too quickly to ensure the best you know the best experience for everyone we have to rate limit you it's like ah like this doesn't work um we're going back and forth and back and forth after more things it's like understood here here's the goal it told me what I wanted it's like the goal is to ensure a clean edgo Edge geometric background with only text centered on the slide and no additional objects or distractions it just could not get it and then it throws this at this stage I recommend using a graphic design tool I can but fig M PowerPoint super this was as close as I could get and this was an hour in and I kept saying please make it lighter please make it lighter please make it lighter and every step along the way it would get darker and darker and darker it was like h so yeah models lie you know I would say things like hey I want you to using cursor I would say hey I want you to put the code in my repository file tree and it would say I said hey can you put it there and it's like certainly I'll create a new file called blah blah blah and I'll put it in this directory and here's the content of the file and I'm like where's the code I kept refreshing my repo and it and there was no code there was no file and I'm like do I not have the write permissions like only vs code has permissions on my files 15 minutes later um it responds with as an AI language model I don't have direct access to your code codebase or file system I was like well then why' you tell me that you built the file so that's a major downside of building with cursor by the way if you want to have the tool output code directly for you and make code edits for you cursor is not quite quite the way to go and we'll get to another tool but anyway this was my feeling um AER a i d r Eric Woo again came to the rescue told me all about AER it's a python tool it uses whatever llm you want to use it'll create all your code for you it'll create all the files for you it'll edit files it'll delete files anytime you ask it to do anything it'll make a git commit for you on your behalf if you don't like it you can roll the code back with just a simple slash command you just slash undo and it undos the commit for you and you can try and try again which is really really good uh I saw this trolling around Reddit a little bit after I'd already built my deck which is great um there's five levels of different um this is a great slide for you to do exploration too to figure out more tools because you probably haven't heard of like a lot of folks hadn't heard of Aer and so they probably hadn't heard of any of the competitors either right but basically you're going to go from co-pilot cursor and then you're going to use AER and then there's a whole bunch of Aer um tools that are and stuff that's like way way more um enterpris so they they tend to lose a lot of context and they lose broken code uh Mike asked me about hey you can just fix the error right I could not get my head wrapped around why it was throwing natural language into code I just couldn't figure that out and it um it happens all the time and that one piece is why I'm not afraid of it taking all of our jobs because if it can't produce valid code and it after 12 iterations like people are not going to adopt the technology that's broken like it's just not quite good enough okay so the tool that I built it's going to have a pretty cool sign up page you're not signing up you're not giving me information but it'll walk you through the whole setup page AI built the whole thing which is pretty rad it built the the neat pricing table down below this is the link if you do want to for some reason grab that QR code right now you can set up your own data pipeline which is Super Rad it'll take about 20 to 30 minutes this is me I've Loved hanging out with you guys today I hope I brought enough energy post lunch for everybody thanks a lot y'all thank you",
        "cleaned_text": "thank you whos ready for a journey most of my decks are kind of journey decks i take you along for the ride uh were going to explore uh what i learned building a tool right so the bulk data export is something that i got super stoked on a year and a half ago because i was part of the small team that developed that tool with google um they they got a lot of insight from a small group of seos to help them develop the tool i hadnt really worked with it a lot and ive always had it in the back of my mind as something that i wanted to explore and work with more deeply and i also had built a product called branch explorer which uses google search console data coming out of the api and it had some limitations because it was only working with at the web search type and it was only gathering 50000 rows of data per day and i always wanted to take branch explorer and marry it together with with this this pipeline and so what i wanted to do why is i know i gave him the right file uh thats the best thing thats ever happened uh so uh what i wanted to do was to marry the two together and i wanted to build a really badass tool that le see the thing thats cool about the bulk data export pipeline is that google handles all the engineering for you they push all the data for you up into the cloud and that makes it super easy from an engineering perspective and i wanted to utilize that data and push it into branch explorer which is a custom view of data and what yall are going to get out of this is actually your own free branch explorer tool and your own data pipelines that you can use yourselves to look at search console data at scale super badass right and i love kangaroos thats not my slide uh someone asked me why its hard i cant believe this im being broadcast to youtube uh uh so i just want to say hi to joy hawkins whos probably watching this right now and im hoping that marie haynes is also watching this because she gets a wicked call out and i also want to take an opportunity here to have you guys take some notes this next piece is not part of my deck but i want you to write down these three words as the most important thing youre going to learn at this conference make me smarter i want all of us to embrace those three words of as we make our way throughout the world there have been plenty times today and yesterday where ive been completely blown away by what im seeing on stage and i felt less than not as smart as not as experienced as has anyone felt that way were all on a journey together right and this is my knowledge right and when i watched kristen tinsky talk today i was feeling like oh my god like her knowledge is so much bigger than mine but the thing is that for all of us all of our sets of knowledge are tangential and overlapping so like just keep in mind as youre making a way and as youre on your journey learning all of this stuff like if your boss sent you here to learn tech seo in a conference right like its really hard to learn all this stuff and you just have to commit yourself to the journey of learning while they figure it out can i ask you a couple questions please do so you also have a seo community which i forgot to mention yeah how would you recommend people getting involved in that okay so the tech excuse me the seoc communitycom right its if you go to that website youll see that theres a page called apply and you apply with your name email and your link d profile that helps us vet that youre a real human being which is kind of important there are about 3200 other marketers a lot of folks who are here are members and moderators mikes a moderator of our testing channel kristens a moderator of our ai uh ai for seo channel and i think its an amazing place uh i took a huge amount of um inspiration for what ar did with women and tech seo and i just thought that um when twitter fell apart i really wanted to not have to look for my friends right like i didnt want to do mastadon i didnt want to do blue sky i didnt know where to look and slack just felt like the smartest way to go okay and like i said youve done so many videos with agency automats and so on and theres people in here when we talk about automation its like its cool but they dont know where to start and i know youre going to talk about that to some degree here yeah but if youre someone coming into this for the first time yeah where would you recommend that they start uh appscript google sheets functions to appscript to javascript or you could take an alternate path which goes appscript to python uh python is a much easier language to learn the javascript whos afraid of learning python anyone does it sound hard does it sound like only smart people do it it is literally the easiest programming language to learn period like the things that are hard about it are like managing indentations like how many spaces do i put right and then also getting packages to work together yeah of course of course but from my perspective anyone can code now because of large language models right you as long as you can describe what you want its going to give you some okay code and if it breaks then you just put the error in and then it fixes it yeah except for like and im going to get into that in the deck but like i basically built i built a data pipeline and i only used ai to build it and i wanted to know if it was possible to build software applications just using do you guys want my laptop we got it okay um i dont believe you i think they del i think they deleted my deck i think they by accident deleted it um but yeah like what i found was that when i built something that was creating javascript it was throwing natural language into the code so instead of like doing end end to equal a and b it would say a and then the word and and b and i was just feeling and i threw that into itself to fix it and it couldnt figure out the error that was that was um chat that was that was claw no that was uh chat gpt 40 so people think that claude sonet is like the best one for writing code i enjoy it a lot and i use it with cursor and i use it with another tool called ader aid d eer were going to talk about that as we go um this is the first time ive ever had a deck completely disappear its there its the combination of adobe pdfs and google slides huh window and windows also oh windows yeah yeah have we solved the problem though all right cool i could laughter tell how you doing no im good im having fun yeah you know i actually like when things go wrong cuz its like you get the opportunity to see what you can do in the moment so i think were good now though so im im going to try this again everybody make some noise for noer y this is amazing okay so were going to go in on a journey im going to share all kinds of stuff that i learned building a really cool tool that you guys will get access to for free im going to share a ton of lessons learned im also going to share a couple custom gpts that i built for you keep in mind all of the slides are available to you so youre going to have them all after so you dont have to like race cuz i have a whole bunch of qr codes that are flashing up on screen but you can scan them you know when you get back to back wherever youre going okay so whats the mashup were building something with the gsc bulk export and were building something with explorer explorer is a looker studio based product that we built that allows you to look at search console data at scale its got all kinds of time series visual ations tables itll allow you to see stuff that you havent seen before and we only built it with this mashup using ai who knows dave sodano i saw him speak at tech seo boost in 2019 and uh he blew me away and he blew me away because he was like the guy on stage talking about javascript and i think he even dropped the words python in his deck which i thought was amazing and hes been a hero of mine a mentor collaborator for a super long time so when i got the opportunity to speak here we had a call together and i said hey dave im thinking about building this thing what do you think and he said oh dude its awesome its amazing you should totally do it everybodys going to eat it up its going to be so cool and then he said this within six months this was two months ago i promise you anyone can build anything with an llm um lets see if hes right and when he said that i thought he was totally crazy because if you think about the technology adoption curve it looks a lot like this i feel like this is kristen people like kristen this is me this is a whole bunch of us in the room this is generalist folk doing marketing these are consumers these are our parents right okay and so when dave said anyone could build anything i thought he was saying that this person could build something within 6 months and thats why i thought he was so super crazy okay and what do we know about the bulk export what is it well its basically three things theres three tables that get pushed up into big query the first ones called the export log second one is the url impression table third one is the site level data sight level data is where its just aggregating all the me metrics for you at the query level the url impression table is aggregating everything at the combination of query and page and its giving you all kinds of other stuff too which well get into um these are the kinds of fields that are available inside the bulk export again youre going to get access to this in the slide this is coming straight out of big query if you havent seen this before its pretty cool specifically that field is anonymized query everybodys always super pissed about what gets sampled right this gives you the visibility to be able to see which pages are getting anonymized queries when i looked at our own data what i saw was that all of the content that we were building about how to use google uh user interfaces how to use google products those pages had ridiculous quantities of anonymized queries it was almost like google didnt want us to know how to compete with them in the serers was how i was thinking about it but also look at all these boolean fields weve got is it a top stories is it a blue link is it a job listing job de details is it an action is it an events listing is it is it an amp is it video is it organic shopping who does ecommerce who would like to have that level of visibility about their data right so these are the kinds of things that are available to you when you start working with the bulk export um youve probably heard that its expensive right tons of data its really expensive well get into that um as getting ready for the build of this i didnt work with the site impression table at all i just didnt have enough time to do it um weve already talked about all of the volume of data but this is why theres so much you get data for all countries so all your data is segregated by country its segregated by all of the devices its segregated by all of the search types its segregated by all the search appearances which were those boolean fields that i shared in the last slide um its also giving you information about anonymous queries and theres no row limits lets say youre cnncom or your reddit uh you have its no longer 50000 rows per day its as much as you want the fire hose is wide open so for enterprise sites its super super interesting what about a small site is it interesting then too yes and well get into that okay so all search types so we get discover google news we get news we get image type we get video we get web super dope and i was also super stoked to build this because i felt like there just werent any tools that i was aware of thats why i have the bracket around the many piece there just werent a lot of tools for specifically looking at data that was coming out of the bulk export and um with explorer these are the types of things that we do on top of the data coming out of search console to make it a lot easier to work with so we have like your position with the bulk export theyre giving you position as a sum theyre not giving it to you as an average position which is super annoying you have to do the math yourself to calculate you know the sum of position by the number of impressions to get to an average position um so we do that math for you uh clickthrough rate full path which is is giving you almost like the google analytics view of your url um were also breaking it up into subdirectory so were giving you insights as uh subdirectory level one 2 3 4 so if you have a site that has a whole bunch of structure youre going to really dig it um were also giving you all kinds of information around funnel stages and the thing that i think youre going to really dig is you can set the search terms in the tool that we give you that align with your different funnel stages which is super badass uh lets see so you can see brand versus nonbrand funnel stage you can see if a url um happens to be something that has utm parameters that align with gbp stuff which is super useful and you can build url segments has anyone ever used bodify so in bodify youve got a pretty cool way of doing segmentation of your else using whatever pattern you want im not positive but i think they do it with a case statement and what that means is that a page can be a or it can be b but it cant be both boom we can do we can have pages be both so a page could be a nike page because it has nike in the url and it could be a product detail page because it has product in the string and it could be a specific collection because it has shoes in it right so you can have one page be all kinds of different segments which is pretty rad the other thing that allows you to do is to see directories pages and queries that are driving change on our website im not telling you how cool this is because theres so much data its not about the volume of data its about having a tool that can help you get efficiently from the hyack down to the needle and thats why ive always been super jacked about explorer because i felt like it was the best tool that id seen that enabled me to do it and because the data is all in big query if youve ever used looker studio and if you use native connectors and youre like this sucks its super slow especially if you have to blend data together youre going to love using it because of how fast it is okay so im going to build something with ai what could possibly go wrong right has anyone ever struggled with chat gpt okay so heres my approach to building tools ive learned a lot talking to a lot of folks in the room about how to do stuff i generally focus on this sweet spot in the vin diagram im looking for stuff thats fast to build easy to code and super cheap to own hopefully free so i build on the google cloud infrastructure generally um i always focus on painkillers not vitamins any aspiring product people in the room and youve ever thought to yourself like hey itd be really cool if i could show blah blah blah thats a vitamin a painkiller is how do i save 100 hours for my agency this month right like thats the stuff that i always focus on they also help us as an agency smooth out capacity challenges as we grow in scale this helps us kind of deal with those capacity changes um last year we had a whole bunch of folks that went out on paternity and maternity to leave we found that all the automations that we put in place helped us deal with that really really well they also help us be really really sticky with our clients when we can solve problems for our clients in ways that other people cant weve got a huge leg up and i dont know if youve heard about sterling sky but were in the local space and were generally known as kind of the premier local agency in north america uh this is the stack that i use i started with google app script i was talking with whoops i was talking with mike about that how do you go backwards its not going backwards okay um i started with google app script and then from there i actually had an agency automator with dave sodano where he taught me how to do cloud functions and i thought it was the coolest thing because cloud functions allow you to have a million invocations for free per month i was like holy thats such a big number like i can do so many cool things with that and i work with apis i also use use um fir store specifically to manage state and thats like storing client variables storing information that i need to read and write a lot and i also use big query like crazy and looker studio for visualization to me if youre trying to figure out what your tech stack should look like i think this is a great place to start you could totally you could totally um get rid of firestore and use postgress um as another database tech there but i think this is a great great way to think about things when i used to build i built exclusively in vs code for two to four years and when copilot came out i was super super jacked when youre thinking about automation and youre thinking about ai in coding copilot is the best way to dip your toes in and the reason why is that when youre working with copilot its basically like youll start typing and itll finish the line of code for it you hit tab and you just move on and so its not like chat gpt where youre like saying hey build me a whole function that does x and it spits out 400 lines of code and you have no idea whats broken this gives you like a very limited way to get started um i loved it i loved it i loved it i loved it um and then i went to canada and i met marie haynes in person i dont know if youve ever spent any time with her but i had one of the most compelling come to jesus talks ive ever had with any human ever where she told me i was doing everything wrong and all i needed to do in life was learn more about ai and use it and i was like you marie and i went home all angry and i made some changes uh i started to use chat gpt at that point this was in october of last year and i started learning about all the things that have to do with this stuff okay tokens a token is a chunk of words or images or text its really small its like four characters um in english each token is like 34 of a word right context window youre going to hear this all the time a context window is this is basically a measurement of the size of information that can go in and out of a large language model and as these technologies have improved context windows have become larger so when you build things that super important because it goes from hey i can build you a line of code like copilot to hey you can have your entire code repository inside that context window so the llm knows everything about what youve built and what youre trying to build and with open ai chat gpt what what we found was that the context window was 8000 tokens sounds like a lot right its like 500 words or 500 no no no no its its 6000 words which is a lot so i built a whole bunch of custom gpts the first one that i built is probably the most useful if you like to code and you want something super useful and you work in the google cloud stack i strongly recommend if you want a gpt to use this one is the i love stackbot i use this almost every day in my work now um it allowed me to go from single line to building complete functions um and i thought it was super cool so i kept going and i built um a wordpress custom gpt i didnt know anything about building anything in wordpress believe it or not and this tool allowed me to build short codes it allowed me to build plugins it it helped me build all kinds of stuff i even built this plugin called the custom taxonomy grid block has anyone ever built something with categories and you hate the standard layout and its awful this thing in two days i figured out how to build one i built an appscript gpt which is awesome because i love appscript if youre and anyone whos wanting to learn like i said earlier like appscript is the easiest thing to learn other than python its super well documented it integrates with all kinds of google tools including google sheets if youre trying to figure out the first step to building cool useful stuff for the agency the superpower do would be appscript plus google sheets okay then i learned about claud sonet 35 which is super cool super powerful huge context window 25 times larger than chat gpt i was like oh my god im in uh i pay for the pro plan its 20 bucks a month strongly recommend you do it um i got super excited about it because it has this feature called artifacts and projects which i heard as custom you know doing the same kind of thing as a custom gpt um i dont know im not super into it i mean this was my take on it the way it works is you have to manually upload your files into into the tool and i just felt like that whole process was super annoying super slow and i just felt like it was a total pain in the ass and the reason why i didnt really dig it is it stopped me from doing the work it stopped me from doing iterations and speed of iteration is really really really the key for me anyway um ive learned so much from everybody else here and they all work differently but this was as i was learning to work with the tools this was one of my big takeaways id heard of this tool called cursor from a guy named eric woo and i jumped in with both feet its super easy if you use vs code to move over to cursor you basically just export your settings out of vs code and import them into cursor it takes 2 minutes whats cool about it is its basically vs code but it has ai built right into the tool theres a free plan and a pro plan free limits how many different ai queries you can do per day the pro plan is 20 bucks a month totally sign me up all day long for that i think its just the coolest thing because its using claud sonet as its builtin model its got this huge context window so it knows a ton about your code im going to share some takeaways from doing this whole build youre like hey wheres the tool wheres the tool well get to that at the end but i just wanted to share some of the lessons that ive learned um and i again like when i watched christen talk like i was feeling impostor syndrome in a huge way but i think these are good best practices to get started i think with when youre working with ai and youre working with llms youre trying to code and build stuff do not say hey i want to build this thing thing and do this describe what youre trying to do in the broadest terms possible describe what your end goals are and then get the llm to reframe back to you what youre trying to accomplish what youre going to find is that when it summarizes that goal its either going to know its going to say something that aligns with how you think or its going to be wrong and if its wrong youre going to iter iteratively communicate with it back and forth until you get the goal right and then what youre going to find is that its the time to then ask it to produce an architecture of the thing that youre trying to build and again it iteratively talk with it to get make sure that you have that all done and then what youre going to do is ask the model to build whats called pseudo code which to me is just like it talking about the code and describing it to you and if you know what youre looking at and you and you then sort of look at the code youll know if theyre on the right track or not i have not done all of the cycles of frustration yet we havent gotten there um were still trying to get it to get the context right and understand what its trying to produce if you get the pseudo code right you then ask it to actually code and then youve basically gotten about 70 of the way there and the last 30 20 10 is the most frustrating part of the experience when i was building the tool that you guys are going to get i was trying to get it to create a data pipeline using only sql and the reason i was trying to do that was that i had a pretty complex architecture beforehand i had cloud functions and task cues and all kinds of infrastructure to support well google was already pushing all the data for me up into the cloud and i was like why cant i just do this with sql what i found was that that last 20 to 30 was brutal it was like 20 hours of going back and forth and back and forth okay other lessons learned doing the build with the bulk export the epoch version field uh table the epoch version field in the export log is really really really interesting id never really thought about this before but the epoch version basically tells you what what version of the data is up in the table so lets say google puts data up in the table on day one and then theyre like oh we have data quality issues and they have to fix it and put it back up as epoch version number one thats really important that told me oh my god i need that that my data is not immutable when you hear about an api you might hear it described as mutable which means the data changes thats like facebook data or ads conversion data this told me that i had to pay attention to that which i thought was really interesting um bulk export data costs lets get into this because this is super super interesting when you go to the tools web page theres going to be a calculator at the bottom of the page thats going to help you think through this basically what youre going to do is look at the data thats in your table and then divide it by the number of partitions that that basically tells you how many megabytes or gigabytes of data are going up into big query every single day and thats going to help you calculate how much the budget is and yeah i did use ai to build that tool on the web page too which was pretty cool um heres a major downside of the bulk export there is no back fill its just like uh ga data also what youre going to find is that dave was wrong dave was wr its not something that i perceive anyway that in 4 months is going to be something that all of us can just go build stuff like i i build things for a living thats my job im like the director of innovation for sterling sky and i found that it was hard i found that it was really frustrating and i found that almost that copilot way of working was an easier way intellectually um to work i could get stuff done probably fast and understanding the wide world of possibilities thats i think the sweet spot for ai but like getting it done efficiently it was just such a frustrating build um and when i talk about early adopters really its like a tolerance for pain and i feel like you had to have just an enormous tolerance for pain to kind of work with it that was that was my piece and you and you really have to be um ready to deal with risk okay also um just to give you all kinds of other insights like models create all kinds of trash outputs like that was that was a key piece i wanted to build my deck with ai too after id already built the tool i was like hey lets lets just build all my slides i think this would be super fun if you want to see how a ai goes wrong by the way if you want to see how to build slides with it but this this is the input like hey i want to build a 16x9 slide because thats what google slides are right and i want it to look um i want it to have like a cool geometric pattern blah blah blah this is what it came out with i just wanted a freaking slide that said building software is hard right 10 iterations later and then it and then it throws an error at me its its like youre generating images too quickly to ensure the best you know the best experience for everyone we have to rate limit you its like ah like this doesnt work um were going back and forth and back and forth after more things its like understood here heres the goal it told me what i wanted its like the goal is to ensure a clean edgo edge geometric background with only text centered on the slide and no additional objects or distractions it just could not get it and then it throws this at this stage i recommend using a graphic design tool i can but fig m powerpoint super this was as close as i could get and this was an hour in and i kept saying please make it lighter please make it lighter please make it lighter and every step along the way it would get darker and darker and darker it was like h so yeah models lie you know i would say things like hey i want you to using cursor i would say hey i want you to put the code in my repository file tree and it would say i said hey can you put it there and its like certainly ill create a new file called blah blah blah and ill put it in this directory and heres the content of the file and im like wheres the code i kept refreshing my repo and it and there was no code there was no file and im like do i not have the write permissions like only vs code has permissions on my files 15 minutes later um it responds with as an ai language model i dont have direct access to your code codebase or file system i was like well then why you tell me that you built the file so thats a major downside of building with cursor by the way if you want to have the tool output code directly for you and make code edits for you cursor is not quite quite the way to go and well get to another tool but anyway this was my feeling um aer a i d r eric woo again came to the rescue told me all about aer its a python tool it uses whatever llm you want to use itll create all your code for you itll create all the files for you itll edit files itll delete files anytime you ask it to do anything itll make a git commit for you on your behalf if you dont like it you can roll the code back with just a simple slash command you just slash undo and it undos the commit for you and you can try and try again which is really really good uh i saw this trolling around reddit a little bit after id already built my deck which is great um theres five levels of different um this is a great slide for you to do exploration too to figure out more tools because you probably havent heard of like a lot of folks hadnt heard of aer and so they probably hadnt heard of any of the competitors either right but basically youre going to go from copilot cursor and then youre going to use aer and then theres a whole bunch of aer um tools that are and stuff thats like way way more um enterpris so they they tend to lose a lot of context and they lose broken code uh mike asked me about hey you can just fix the error right i could not get my head wrapped around why it was throwing natural language into code i just couldnt figure that out and it um it happens all the time and that one piece is why im not afraid of it taking all of our jobs because if it cant produce valid code and it after 12 iterations like people are not going to adopt the technology thats broken like its just not quite good enough okay so the tool that i built its going to have a pretty cool sign up page youre not signing up youre not giving me information but itll walk you through the whole setup page ai built the whole thing which is pretty rad it built the the neat pricing table down below this is the link if you do want to for some reason grab that qr code right now you can set up your own data pipeline which is super rad itll take about 20 to 30 minutes this is me ive loved hanging out with you guys today i hope i brought enough energy post lunch for everybody thanks a lot yall thank you",

        "raw_text": "thanks Mike we uh we as speakers all Drew straws to see who got to uh follow Mike King and uh unfortunately I didn't win um but I'm excited to to speak to speak with you guys today about developing automated SEO tools and share some of the things that we've learned recently about search in the age of large language models um so as you've probably heard from a number of speakers today search kind of really changed with the launch of chat GPT uh everything's a little bit different for us now um when we think about that what what has changed for seos what's different for us today than it was previously well it's becoming more and more clear that search engines are going through the process of changing from search to becoming answer engines that's really what their goal is uh they want to provide the answers for people so that they don't have to go look for them um we're seeing this not just with Google we're seeing it with co-pilot chat gbt others that are entering this space uh they are very particularly interested in being able to provide you with the answer you're looking for exactly when you need it instead of having you have to take the effort to go search for it um but an interesting thing that you've seen from Mike and others that are talking about it is is that with the release of chat GPT we suddenly had competition for the first time in this sphere uh competition to become the answer engine and so that also led to the increase of access to tools that power these search engines so we have Google vertex AI that Mike kingm referenced providing details and access to apis related to text embeddings these Vector databases open AI co-pilot Gemini open source language models um lots of other areas and we've also heard speakers today talk about Google's Cloud Library being increasingly accessible for things like natural language processing apis and tools and references to us so one of the other benefits that we have from all of this is that costs have decreased significantly in some examples they've in decreased 99.9% um this is actually the cost for Google's natural language processing API from March 20 23 uh you can see on the left it was $1 for every 1,000 token uh 1,000 characters that you processed and now it's 0.001 Cent for every 1,000 characters you process so significantly reducing the cost to allow us to do things with these tools that we probably just couldn't afford to do at scale previously um with all of these tools that became have become available one of the things that I like to do as I'm learning things is is to actually build with them uh I am not a developer by trade uh I am a technical SEO by trade like many of you um but I like to jump into things uh to really understand them because then I think you can make better decisions better recommendations and get a search from how that does so I'm going to share a little bit about um what I built to help me understand all these Technologies and how they work together uh one of the things that we were having is as we have uh language models that are really powerful that can do lots of things we have voice models that can do things like clone voices and replicate things we also have um the these Vector embeddings that basically allow us to have semantic search capability that we never had previously which is an extremely uh powerful tool to get to information so I like to build projects not just related to SEO to learn things but other areas and I'd encourage you to do the same and one of the things that I started to do to learn these Technologies is I I had access to my grandfather's journals and I said hey this is a corpus of documents it's similar to search uh what if I could take this Corpus of documents and I could vectorize them and embed them and stick them into a vector embedding uh database and then with that Vector embedding database what if I could then tell a language model that it was my grandfather and what if I told my grandfather's language model that it had access to a collection of memories and those collection of memories were its um its journal entries right and then what if I had a recording of my grandfather and I was able to take and clone his voice my grandfather died in 1989 he was a World War II vet and uh I put all of this together all these Technologies to see what would happen uh and we created chat GPT with Grandpa Hank and so joined the army in part because of a shady story and deal about a motorboat and because my cousin was leaving for the Marines getting my mother's signature for enlistment was the hardest part but I managed to convince her after finishing school I enlisted and left for the war on June 30th 1942 so all of these Technologies are pretty crazy and incredible for me I was ble to hear my grandfather again and ask him questions and get answers that were based on his real life in his own words and with his own voice it's incredible powerful technology but through it all it helped me understand also the technologies that we can use in my day-to-day life with my with my job um these language models they've lowered costs the tools are more accessible they're easy to easier to access and because of that we can create powerful automated SEO tools so going to talk a little bit about what are some of the things that would limit us from being able to be successful with these tools so large language models they've got weaknesses one of the things that we often hear is they're bad at math they hallucinate they have limited memory although that's becoming less and less of a problem definitely was when we were first starting this process with these tools and so when we had G fish we were thinking about all these things we started to think well these these language models they're used by search engines uh and they must have figured out a way to get past these if they're going to deploy it into their search product right like there has to be a way for us so we started to wonder well what can we do as SEO to solve these same process these same type of problems to be confident enough that we could automate these things at scale how can we use these at scale with confidence that they're not going to give us bad data hallucinate make things up or run out of memory um so one of the first things we saw was just related to math right like hey don't use large language models for title tags or metad descriptions small simple things that we have to do all the time they can't count characters they make things up but we started to think about it too and we said you know I'm an SEO and if you ask me to create a 100 title tags without using a tool to determine how many characters I had used and if I met that threshold of 60 if I was going to be over or under it I would I would probably fail I wouldn't do that well at it in a language model on its own it fails about 60% of the time but uh we learned that if you gave language models tools to check their work um they did a pretty good job of that so what we did is as chat gbt and other language models have the ability to call functions functions can be things like calculators they can be tools that work for you and so we gave language model through functions the ability to do things like check character length an interesting thing happened is is that when we first started this we just returned back to them the characters like 35 60 5 and the language models didn't quite know what to do with that and so we have a tip that is is if you actually return information the way that language models work best with instructions they do significantly better so our function returns things like title tag is too long with 65 characters please write a shorter one and when we made that change we saw that language models ability to check their own work reduce their air rates in terms of character count from 60% to 1% so sign ific Improvement that we could solve and be confident that we could build automated tools on in scale moving to the next topic uh language models can't be trusted they hallucinate and make things up uh this one was a a fun challenge to to problem to solve and there's a few things that we found out is is that like if you actually give language mod models the ability to say I don't know they'll use it right like that's one of the things they're statistically predicting what the best answer is and if they don't know the answer often the statistical best prediction is I don't know if you give them that access and the other thing is is that you'll hear people with retrieval augmented generation rag the ability to grab answers and include it in prompts if you give the answers based on retrieving information from Vector databases or other sources that language models do a pretty good job of not hallucinating or making things up so wanted to just show you an example of how this might work so you have an example a user prompt to a language model might be something like did the Dallas Cowboys win the Super Bowl what we could do pro programmatically to make sure a language model didn't hallucinate would be to send it something like this did the Dallas Cowboys win the Super Bowl use the data below to answer the question if there is no answer in the data reply with I don't know and then you inject the data that you've gathered from some other source in this case you know this example the D Dallas Cowboys did not go to the Super Bowl sorry Dallas Cowboy fans uh and what a response would be something like this is the Dallas Cowboys did not win the Super Bowl if the data didn't include that information with this prompt that we just showed here it would actually reply with I don't know because that's the statistically most relevant answer based on the prompt that you had sent it um so how do we as technical seos include answers to all of the possible questions for queries in the prompt like there's infinite possibilities with data when we're working across wide ranges of websites and other areas and how how do we then solve that limited memory problem so one of the things that we talked about when I showed that demo of my grandfather is is that we need to actually act more like search engines now we need to gather information through things like API scraping content natural language processing tools we need to organize it similar to what a search engine does with databases and then we may need to retrieve it through code to include into language model prompts when it's needed most so NE another words we need to do exactly what search engines do every day they crawl data organize it in a database and retrieve the information and present it to a user when they need it most so how can we get answers for SEO uh one of those things we're going to talk about and Mike went into a lot of detail and I'll go through quickly is Google's vertex AI text embeddings um or other embedding models my language of choice is python but you can use JavaScript or any type of other area to help receive information and then one of the things we need is this API access we use Ser API a lot because it gets us quick clean data information structured for seeing what's happening in the search results for a specific time when we're running and doing automated information queries so just real quickly Mike went into a lot of detail but this text embedding model is a process of taking text moving it into a model getting a a numeric representation of the meaning of that text that lives in that Vector space that we've heard about today um just the quick summary things that are similar to each other are going to be more closely related and located to each other and then we can identify and understand the similarity of topics or grab answers that are most related to the topics we're talking about by measuring cosine similarity the things that are closest to each other so Vector embeddings cosine similarities is is is a crucial tool for us for building automated SEO tools moving forward it's something where if you don't learn about it if you don't know much about it today is that's the homework go home understand this concept it's going to change everything that you do moving forward uh and it's going to and allow us to answer to pass questions and with answers to large language models so that they can be accurate one of the things that we saw when we started working with vector embeddings and language models is that we see Google using similarity scores all of the time it's most likely the way that they rewrite metad descriptions I'm going to show three metad descriptions for the same page that change based on the query entered so in this example you can see is like how is an IP address assigned the The Meta description answers that question right it's a it's assigned by an ISP um that same page but with a slightly different query what is an IP address and an IP address is a unique numerical identifier right so the only thing that changed was The Meta description in the query the page didn't change and then a third version like how many versions of IP addresses are there and it's there are two versions of IP addresses right so Google was able to identify the text on your site that is most semantically similar to the the query and has identified that they get better click-through or engagement data if they include that as The Meta description so if you're frustrated with your meta descriptions not being uh being used it means that they're not relevant to the queries that they're being asked they're not semantically relevant to them so we thought at at go fish like hey what if we could do this same thing what if we could look at content in a similar way to what Google does and uh so we decided to build a Chrome extension that does a lot of this and it's in private beta if you guys are interested in it send me a message on LinkedIn and and we can have conversation but we're going to be releasing this soon uh essentially it's taking all the text on your site passing that to Google's vertex em uh vertex text embedding model receiving that information back measuring the distance between the target keyword and then updating the Dom with the score and a heat map so this similarity School essentially is as you enter Target keyword you hit go processes all the content in your site and then overlays that on the page so that you can see exactly what parts of the text on your site are semantically scoring well in which or not you can help you identify what areas of the site potentially uh need content updates and then we also generate a page similarity score our belief is is that this is similar to the content uh Warehouse database content Warehouse leak in the way that we were reading the instructions is is that Google is probably taking an average of all of the nodes on the page and creating an average embedding from them to generate a page similarity uh a page score and then they do the same thing at scale to get your site score um so these new tools at affordable prices allow us to automate information gathering and content scoring to provide better SEO recommend founds it's it's a ground baking initial process for us but what are some examples of ways that we can actually automate SEO how can we make this go faster for us um so some of the examples that we have have used and built in in one of these is like we can review the search result page pretty quickly identify search intend and content freshness we can do that through language models like search API I'm sorry open Ai and then from apis like Sur API uh hre's recently introduced this feature into the their just data set but doing a similar process to what you can do manually um other areas that we can do it is we can identify helpful content gaps from competing sites by leveraging larger language models so you can use Python scrape content from a number of different sites pass that organized content over to language models uh a pro tip if you're trying to compare data for language models um the best way to do that I found is Json uh structuring the information in Json and passing it to language models Works similar to what we would see in like a table language models like Json it's really easy for them to understand um you can discover Information Gain opportunities Mike talked a little bit about this one of the ways to do it is is if you pass the content from a collection of Corpus of documents and then you compare them all against each other you can identify what are the common facts on all of these Pages which ones are the unique facts and then what's missing from your site or your client site and it can do that all at scale and quickly through the combination of language models in python content scraping uh you can review content uh on a on a page to see if it's answering to people also ask question apis like Ser API can get you that detailed information pass that through a language model and ask is it answering these questions on your client's page if it's not let us know in this example we can see that we show both the search answer was it answered by a client and then what the client's answer was so you can compare like how is this answer different than the answer that Google has suggested as the best answer for that particular question and then also the red red items would identify that this content didn't answer that people also asked question uh you can create these vector embeddings and generate similar scores for clients in competing pages so similar to that Chrome extension you can build it into automated tools grab that content score it at the node level the the HTML tag level so you can see what parts of your content is scoring uh slowly one of the great benefits our team uses this for is we can actually make recommended changes and see what the changes would do to the similarity score before we publish it live so you can click make updates to the text re rescore the content and see is this moving in the right direction or is it going to hurt our content before we publish it um you can also do what Mike was talking about with uh if you then create a page embedding for every single page on a site you can then get your site Authority score the page scores and you can then compare it against multiple competitors and so you can see verse Target keywords it's hard to see a little bit but the green dots down at the bottom versus two sites that are competing for those queries we can see the orange site has a lot more information a lot more topical Authority even though they're not as closely related to the the target keywords help us make content decisions based on that uh you can do things really simple like hey let's just grab all the IM on a page in the alt text in the file names and see which ones are missing which ones are doing so we can quickly make recommendations at scale and we can use the correct tools for the correct purposes right so if we're trying to understand entities we can use Google's natural language processing entity we can grab that from multiple pages and compare them against each other so we can see which ones are missing from particular Pages at scale then make recommendations on what to do to the content to integrate those entities that we're missing and we can even do things like make a good guess at topical Authority one way to do that is to use search API to get search results for each of the sites do by doing a site query plus the keyword that's going to give you a good idea of the number of pages that are returning for our particular topic if you then compare the content to each of those pages with semantic similarity and their page embeddings you can then see which ones are most relevant to that content and you can identify if there's Gap in your content for a topical Authority that you're trying to rank for in this example for SEO for construction companies Gish digital needs to write some more articles so that we can be a little bit more of a subject matter expert on that area uh one of the other things is you can use all these tools to identify internal linking opportunities through an automated process and at scale again you looking at all of the number of pages you find the paragraphs on those pages that are the most semantically similar to a particular keyword getting semantic scoring and that Returns the document so you can see like Hey we're not linking on these pages but we should because we have paragraphs that talk about these topics throughout the site and we can grab that information so and there's so much more that you can create right we've heard lots of people today and yesterday talk about all of these new technologies the different ways that you would use them for your particular Industries the reality is is it's it's endless and I showed that example at the beginning of my grandfathers is that like it's something that you can do these tools are incredibly easy to use now um versus years ago in addition to that we have these large language models that can help us build things so that's one thing I just want to make sure everyone is confident that they can go and do that um so all those screenshots you saw come from a tool that we use internally that we call Barracuda um it's essentially the process of going out gathering information about a particular client's web page in the competing Pages aggregating it back together typically that process before we automated a lot of those steps um took about four hours it was gathering information pulling it together and then we'd make recommendations Barracuda now goes and gathers all of that same information to allow our SEO teams to use that information to then make recommendations um and it gathers all that in about four minutes so you know the time saved by just being able to go automate these tasks use these tools and Technologies can be a significant Advantage for you in terms of what you're doing so in conclusion just want to make sure that everyone understands this there's so many tools that make us make it that are available to us to help us do what we do uh and accessing these tools is cheaper and easier than they've ever been and that we can use these tools to automate information gathering scoring content and allowing us to make recommendations that make an impact thank you",
        "cleaned_text": "thanks mike we uh we as speakers all drew straws to see who got to uh follow mike king and uh unfortunately i didnt win um but im excited to to speak to speak with you guys today about developing automated seo tools and share some of the things that weve learned recently about search in the age of large language models um so as youve probably heard from a number of speakers today search kind of really changed with the launch of chat gpt uh everythings a little bit different for us now um when we think about that what what has changed for seos whats different for us today than it was previously well its becoming more and more clear that search engines are going through the process of changing from search to becoming answer engines thats really what their goal is uh they want to provide the answers for people so that they dont have to go look for them um were seeing this not just with google were seeing it with copilot chat gbt others that are entering this space uh they are very particularly interested in being able to provide you with the answer youre looking for exactly when you need it instead of having you have to take the effort to go search for it um but an interesting thing that youve seen from mike and others that are talking about it is is that with the release of chat gpt we suddenly had competition for the first time in this sphere uh competition to become the answer engine and so that also led to the increase of access to tools that power these search engines so we have google vertex ai that mike kingm referenced providing details and access to apis related to text embeddings these vector databases open ai copilot gemini open source language models um lots of other areas and weve also heard speakers today talk about googles cloud library being increasingly accessible for things like natural language processing apis and tools and references to us so one of the other benefits that we have from all of this is that costs have decreased significantly in some examples theyve in decreased 999 um this is actually the cost for googles natural language processing api from march 20 23 uh you can see on the left it was 1 for every 1000 token uh 1000 characters that you processed and now its 0001 cent for every 1000 characters you process so significantly reducing the cost to allow us to do things with these tools that we probably just couldnt afford to do at scale previously um with all of these tools that became have become available one of the things that i like to do as im learning things is is to actually build with them uh i am not a developer by trade uh i am a technical seo by trade like many of you um but i like to jump into things uh to really understand them because then i think you can make better decisions better recommendations and get a search from how that does so im going to share a little bit about um what i built to help me understand all these technologies and how they work together uh one of the things that we were having is as we have uh language models that are really powerful that can do lots of things we have voice models that can do things like clone voices and replicate things we also have um the these vector embeddings that basically allow us to have semantic search capability that we never had previously which is an extremely uh powerful tool to get to information so i like to build projects not just related to seo to learn things but other areas and id encourage you to do the same and one of the things that i started to do to learn these technologies is i i had access to my grandfathers journals and i said hey this is a corpus of documents its similar to search uh what if i could take this corpus of documents and i could vectorize them and embed them and stick them into a vector embedding uh database and then with that vector embedding database what if i could then tell a language model that it was my grandfather and what if i told my grandfathers language model that it had access to a collection of memories and those collection of memories were its um its journal entries right and then what if i had a recording of my grandfather and i was able to take and clone his voice my grandfather died in 1989 he was a world war ii vet and uh i put all of this together all these technologies to see what would happen uh and we created chat gpt with grandpa hank and so joined the army in part because of a shady story and deal about a motorboat and because my cousin was leaving for the marines getting my mothers signature for enlistment was the hardest part but i managed to convince her after finishing school i enlisted and left for the war on june 30th 1942 so all of these technologies are pretty crazy and incredible for me i was ble to hear my grandfather again and ask him questions and get answers that were based on his real life in his own words and with his own voice its incredible powerful technology but through it all it helped me understand also the technologies that we can use in my daytoday life with my with my job um these language models theyve lowered costs the tools are more accessible theyre easy to easier to access and because of that we can create powerful automated seo tools so going to talk a little bit about what are some of the things that would limit us from being able to be successful with these tools so large language models theyve got weaknesses one of the things that we often hear is theyre bad at math they hallucinate they have limited memory although thats becoming less and less of a problem definitely was when we were first starting this process with these tools and so when we had g fish we were thinking about all these things we started to think well these these language models theyre used by search engines uh and they must have figured out a way to get past these if theyre going to deploy it into their search product right like there has to be a way for us so we started to wonder well what can we do as seo to solve these same process these same type of problems to be confident enough that we could automate these things at scale how can we use these at scale with confidence that theyre not going to give us bad data hallucinate make things up or run out of memory um so one of the first things we saw was just related to math right like hey dont use large language models for title tags or metad descriptions small simple things that we have to do all the time they cant count characters they make things up but we started to think about it too and we said you know im an seo and if you ask me to create a 100 title tags without using a tool to determine how many characters i had used and if i met that threshold of 60 if i was going to be over or under it i would i would probably fail i wouldnt do that well at it in a language model on its own it fails about 60 of the time but uh we learned that if you gave language models tools to check their work um they did a

characters like 35 60 5 and the language models didnt quite know what to do with that and so we have a tip that is is if you actually return information the way that language models work best with instructions they do significantly better so our function returns things like title tag is too long with 65 characters please write a shorter one and when we made that change we saw that language models ability to check their own work reduce their air rates in terms of character count from 60 to 1 so sign ific improvement that we could solve and be confident that we could build automated tools on in scale moving to the next topic uh language models cant be trusted they hallucinate and make things up uh this one was a a fun challenge to to problem to solve and theres a few things that we found out is is that like if you actually give language mod models the ability to say i dont know theyll use it right like thats one of the things theyre statistically predicting what the best answer

to write some more articles so that we can be a little bit more of a subject matter expert on that area uh one of the other things is you can use all these tools to identify internal linking opportunities through an automated process and at scale again you looking at all of the number of pages you find the paragraphs on those pages that are the most semantically similar to a particular keyword getting semantic scoring and that returns the document so you can see like hey were not linking on these pages but we should because we have paragraphs that talk about these topics throughout

        "raw_text": "all right guys Jr told me to do this so that you would all wake up and pay attention to me who wants a t-shirt okay so that's not embarrassing at all I know right I'm Oprah up in here Oprah SEO yeah so I am I'm going to talk about chasing the googlebot trail and I'm pretty sure everybody's like what does that mean uh I speak mostly about crawling the reason I speak about crawling the most is because it's the most important part of SEO I said that because many of you are like our jobs don't rely on crawling jewelry and I'm like yes it does it's where your strategies should start for everything so that's what I'm going to talk about first we're going to talk about Google search console and the tools you can use in there we are going to talk about entry points and we've talked about log files things like that so everybody here knows what an entry point is it's where Google's coming into the site we're fixing technical difficulties while I'm doing this uh I don't know if you've ever built a crawl map but part of the Google bot trail that I'm talking about is understanding how Google enters navigates and understands your website but as seos you guys have heard a lot of stuff today about proving our points measurement and being able to explain ourselves technical seos suffer from this the most right we're trying to get budget we're trying to work with engineering we're trying to work within marketing sometimes we have to deal with product then we have analytics and the list goes on and on but we talk about it from like an Enterprise perspective and sometimes a midium a mid-grade perspective and sometimes for small sites I want to talk about it from the perspective that you should be able to do things manually you should be able to do things with tools or without tools and use whatever you do have because let's be honest not everybody has access to server logs so I'm going to be able to tell you guys about you know taking some of that data turning it into strategy after you map everything out and how to use these maps that you get from all these tools because having tools for the sake of using them doesn't help anybody Mike already talked about me uh so first like crawl stats right you guys are like Jory that was out in 2020 we all know about them it's not a big deal but for a lot of people it is because you're working with clients who maybe they don't have access to their server logs or if you want to expedite your point and get them to do what you need them to do they need to see immediate response and they need you to take action on it something we can all get access to is crawl stats so it's an easy way to not necessarily get all the logs but actually make your point about why you need them so yeah I made it a little bit dramatic but the reason it's so dramatic is I said this before crawling is the most important you want to know why I think crawling is the most important other than you know Google can't access anything without it if you if you went to the Google Docs and you're using the developer tools right and you're reading everything what percentage do you think crawling takes up of the Google documentation that they give to developers and technologist like us if you take away structured data it makes up 70% of the content provided so 70% right I think that's pretty important then that we focus on crawling so the stats report I'm going to go briefly into it give you some highlights about ways to use it little tidbits you can pull out from it not too detailed but if you've seen it you go to the settings most of you have seen it okay good good good like 20% of the room I don't know what the rest of you back there are using but it's okay all right so crawl stats are going to give us things like the crawl requests how many times Google's trying to visit and download things the download size how big are the page is you know not a big deal things that I really think are going to be important your average uh oh your average response time sorry and then the other thing that I think isn't that important but is is going to be your host status so total crawl requests how many people think that more requests is better okay so four people five five people in the room think more requests is better so you think being crawled less is good the rest of the room exactly it depends so a lot of times what you'll find is you come up against questions like well what do we want to do with our crawl budget and why do we need all these requests and why are you asking us for logs and why does this matter and the thing is is there's no specific answer you can't say well more requests is better or you know less requests is good but what you can do is help people understand how do we model around the requests that we want and that's one of the things I'm going to talk about is how do we get to a place where we can explain what it is we want how many requests we should expect and then what do we do if we don't get them and what do we do when we are more adjustments okay so part of what I tend to do and like I said I'm going to go through manually being able to do things using tools and some of you who are pretty you know apt to scripting there's going to be somebody talking tomorrow about building out your own app scripts I've done quite a few tools here that I use if you see a tool that you like or I tell you hey I built an appscript for that it's absolutely okay to find me later and say hey can I get access to that absolutely you can but one of the things that we want to make sure when we're looking at these craw requests download your data regularly okay there's no easy way to export this data there's no API that's going to give it to you so you're going to have to do it manually unless you want to break Google rules and find a way to automat automatically do it with a macro I would never do anything like that okay but if you do and you need to like get that data out of there you you do what you got to do um one of the other things that you're going to want to look at your XML sitemaps those are your money Pages I've seen XML sit maps that are filled with trash but we as seos know we cultivate those to Target the things that are specific so you you should have an XML sitemap count that's matching the requests that you have your indexation count okay if your XML sitemap is supposed to be your goal right that's the gold and then you have indexation that's less than that you are not me meeting your goal if your call requests do not match that freak see what I did there okay not everybody some of you're not there yet but that's okay um but if it's not matching one of the things you want to know is where do I dig into these kinds of reports are going to let us know that right the counts aren't right so how do we know how long that's supposed to take I'm going to show you one of my my actual clients I filtered out a bunch of stuff but they came to me with an indexation problem that they didn't know was an indexation problem because what they told me was we have a really big site and I was like what's really big and they're like you know like hundreds of thousands of euros and I was like it's not that big it's it's fine they're like but Jory we have like 150,000 URLs that are supposed to be in the index and I said who told you they're supposed to be and they're like our other SEO and I was like get rid of that guy got me right but I'm silly if you can't tell um one of the things that I told him is you know I'm going to give myself a deadline to help you guys out so I looked at their XML sitemap I asked them are these your money money Pages they're like yeah these are the money pages I look at the indexation you guys see there's 65,000 there so there's there's probably a gap right around 880,000 URLs are missing you guys see this number 49 when you guys do your quick Mental Math how many of you guys were like it's going to take 11 days to get the rest in there because at the crawl rate that we have we got 10,000 being in there the distribution is 7 to3 so yeah 11 days should get us at you know 7,000 discovered urls if you thought 11 days your math is wrong uh it's not your fault you do know how to do math but this is recursive right we're going to have to take the amount that we newly discover and move them over into the ones that are getting reindexed and so I built a tool for that because I'm too lazy to do it manually on my own and the estimated time I gave them was I was like in around 50 days I can get you fully indexed okay that's very powerful as a technical SEO to be able to give someone a deadline tell them why and how you're going to do it and tell them where the problem area is before you even ask them can I get access to your crawl logs can I get your engineers to do something for me you're already proving your value and your worth so total download size I actually don't care about this metric at all um I think it's valuable if you see that the bot is getting bogged down uh but if you're getting crawled at the rate that you really expect and you're seeing the indexation there ignore it now if it's too high if you're not getting the crawl budget that you expect that's when I expect you to dig a little deeper into this metric but I'm not actually going to go into that metric very much because it's it's mostly inconsequential average response time most people are going to look at this and think time to First Bite because what do we think right we send the message the bite hits the server responds bam they get the bite back and most of us consider that time to first bite if you actually look at the definition that Google gives you in search console it's not time to First Bite they actually expect the last bite to be included and they're ignoring a bunch of other things so it's mostly the HTML that they're looking at referencing now we talked about Automation and tools and everything like that one of the things that I found is that no matter which way you slice this data and explain it to your customer or client Google search console will never give you the actual data to be able to figure out how they do their average response time if you use any external tools you're probably going to have a problem there too you want to know why because Google bot is crawling from where it's choosing to crawl and hitting your servers wherever they're at so the times don't match now I'm going to give you one of those tidbits that I told you I'll I'll drop little nuggets that you guys might like this is what I use and the reason I use this uh Dom content load and yes I know for everybody that's a technologist who's thinking right now Jory that doesn't come from the server you are correct it's the browser side but it's an identical metric served from the browser and that event fires right after your time to First buite in your page load so after your server response Dom content load happens the event triggers so you're going to be within like micro milliseconds of your actual time is that accurate I haven't been up here for 48 minutes you didn't reset my time uh so one of the things I'll tell you is it's okay to use this I actually got chewed out in the Google forums for saying this but it's true I've tested it multiple times against the average response rate that's actually delivered in search console and this is the thing that's going to most accurately match it so if you're going to take anything away Empower yourselves you can do this from the browser side and show your customers right in their face these are the load responses and issues that we're having this is why your average response time is important why it's down and let's you know get some things going people like real data real time host status I told you I really don't care about this one um but I do so here's the thing host status doesn't matter unless you have a problem Google's not really going to tell you if you have a problem that's the problem I have with with this particular report is when you have a problem it's a 90-day problem and it's if it's greater than 5% of your problem how many people have 90 days to wait for a 5% problem to tell them that they need to fix their hosting I don't I don't think so we can't go back in time so don't really use this to level set any playing Ground don't use this to to try and convince them that they need to change their host um usually it's not as problematic as it seems but do use this if you see the red flags because it tells you where to start digging a little deeper so your average response time is tanking you see that there's a host status issue you see that it lasted longer than 10 days it's over the 5% threshold now you actually know where you should go dig and and dive you know to go look at the eror report and you can look at the little blip that tells you what day it happened that's when you're going to go into your server logs if you have them if you don't have server logs we all have this we can go into the indexation report and do a URL inspection around that time for the errors that were happening now you can dig into the problem at the URL level help determine it again without asking for too much access because the more access we ask for the harder the job becomes for the client for us right uh so part two this is a really really short part so don't expect like massive slides there's like two um but I think mapping Google pot and its entry points is very important for everybody to understand how are they getting in we got tools like screaming frog and other tools that help you map how you might crawl it but you really want to understand how Google's crawling and getting in and the referral URLs so things that you're going to need to be able to do this again I wrote an appscript to do this because I'm too lazy and I use chat GPT um but your Discovery and refresh reports these are those reports that I told you you do not want to use a macro to automatically download out of Google Search console because it's against Google's rules um your access logs again optional use Google search console if you need to your XML sitemap report this is that thing that I told you is where all your money pages are your un URL inspection report I access this through Google search consoles API how many people use the API to regularly access the data awesome those of you who are not the people who raise their hands are being very very smart here's why they're being very very smart when you use the API you get more access to the same views that you're getting in search console but you don't have the ability to capture or go backwards in time you'll get those data points at any any point in time because you can actually reference the dates send that back and get it delivered to you so I think it's very important for you to use search console if you don't know how to use the API ask me for the script go to Cloud console activate it and then you can use this very easily then the backlinks report go atrs um I think that if you don't understand what backlinks you have you're going to have a really hard time understanding some of the referral URLs that you're getting the traffic from these are actually more important than most people think because we talk a lot about our internal linking but the Assumption with internal linking is Google's already gotten there one of the things that I've noticed in search console that's you know great especially out of URL inspection but very difficult to do at scale if you're not using the API is how do you identify which backlinks are valuable to you versus not when you use this tool you'll get a table that spews out like this beautifully presented to keep it really simple and this is for your client as well as you but it's going to tell you which URLs are getting that activity so your entry paths and it already parses out which backlinks are sending them things like that in your referral URLs the table was too big to span the whole screen so there's a lot that we could scroll left to but I can't today um so you'll get your discovered URL distribution you're going to get uh your ref your refresh the XML and and all of this good stuff now why do I think that this kind of a table is important to you this is easy to share with your customer but it's also easy for you to utilize to figure out where to dig deep one of the problems here that you'll look at that first year that's money right like that looks great I got eight back links everything good is happening if you're wondering why it says yourdomain.com that's what I replace my client's domain with but I can see the crawl data I can see that the page is okay I can see that it's being refreshed I can see that it's in my index so I know that that's right now what you're going to look for is the flags where things aren't the way that you plann this is why I said it's all part of your strategy if your strategy is to get somebody deeper into the website into a category page you pop everything in here and your category Pages have a couple of these NOS you already know there's something wrong with the category Pages now I need to investigate the entry mapping to those go in to the Ural index report again and find out does it have backlinks yes or no if it doesn't have backlinks you might need a new entry point does it have internal links yes or no now you know the easy solutions to figuring out how to navigate and one once again easily presenting the information getting somebody to use it quickly and not having a problem you can also do this manually I don't suggest it that's why I wrote the appscript but all of these can be exported manually and you can do the exact EXA same thing especially if you have a smaller site so I don't know if you guys have picked up on this yet but I'm a little lazy so I'm going to talk about multiple ways to do this but I'm probably going to tell you the laziest way tools tasks and tactics you got to use the right tools or bad things happen I saw you laugh it's funny I know uh so we've got a lot of tools in fact there's a lot of tools here and I'm actually going to talk about a couple of them that are here today because they're great tools for helping you map out this crawl map the thing that the crawl map is supposed to help you understand entry points yes blockage points opportunity points as well it's hard to see when you're doing Enterprise search if you got a million eurs can you really find the one little spot where everything's getting bogged down absolutely not but what these m can help you with is figuring out which templates which themes which areas and access points aren't available so screaming frog I put it first not because it's the best tool I love screaming frog and it's a great tool I put it first because it's the most accessible tool that's going to give you the tools that you need and their log analyzer is lovely you get some okay Graphics it's free so if you're not familiar with logs and you don't want to understand whether or not you're going to have to filter parse and fix them this is a great opportunity for you to use a free tool see how you feel about the log files and decide whether or not you're going to use logs or ask for them at all because a lot of times nobody wants to give you access anyway secondly things that I love about the tool you can pretty much filter data any way you imagine okay and the reason that's powerful is we're not working at one URL at a time we're working on URL patterns when you filter you can get to a pattern faster other things that I really like is that it's really simple right this looks like what I build in my Excel spreadsheets all by myself so I feel comfortable with that a lot of executives are comfortable with that too so it's not that big of a deal now things that aren't great if you need to rasle Dazzle your client this is not the tool that you're going to pull the pictures from and be like look what I did boss it's not that great if your logs are malformed and what that means is if the log lines are not coming in and they're getting bundled if you have regular Expressions that are getting fed in by you know black Bots um it's not going to clean that up for you and there's not really an easy way to do that you have to figure that out on your own and then it can be a little much right if it's your first time using the tool and you're not trying to overanalyze it's going to give you a lot more than you expect so if you are that kind of person where you want it a little simpler you want the visuals and everything else I I love jet octopus for this um it's got some great benefits they do have a free trial I actually talked to Serge and he told me to tell you that it's seven days but if you came to this conference for limited time only it's 14 days for you too um he did say that for real I I swear um but things that are phenomenal very easy to see things are grouped very well you going and give me the time all right I got to go faster guys you let me talk too slow uh it supports multiple data sources so if you're working Enterprise earlier you might have heard Philly say you got to pay attention to where the logs are coming from yep CDN it'll let you pull in AWS it'll let you pull in all your local logs if you have them in data dog you can pull in so it's great you can also set up custom monitoring which I think is phenomenal things that aren't so great you know it's it costs money um if you don't have deep engineering experience or access you need a devops person to be able to implement this correctly when it's implemented correctly Flawless but if if it's not it's going to be some work that team is really willing to do that work with you though the other thing is it takes a learning curve so if you are not about adoption and you are not trying to Advocate it's it's going to be a tool that's more robust than everybody can use and you won't be able to train them on it that's the manual downloads that I don't do with macros you can do this too uh manual charting which I I won't do but you can draw these and you can draw these conclusions and show people these the thing that's not going to be so great you're not going to be able to hit those nodes really quickly am I going fast enough now um all right so I told you manual I told you tools this is the middle of the road I bet you guys know what I'm going to say I built a tool that did this for me in ABS scripts and I used chat GPT I actually did um and the thing is is it's not beautiful but like not every tool is beautiful it's not perfect but the thing is is you can customize things the way that you want so one of the things I did is I customized heat mapping into the nodes so that I can pull them out really easily so I don't actually pay attention to any of the noise except for the little dark blobs um hey it's true so anybody a fan here I made this one myself so I'm very very proud of my third eye uh so now that we've gazed into the Multiverse and everybody knows what's going on how can you use some of the stuff that I gave you and this is the stuff I'll go through really fast but it's the most important stuff for you so I'm glad I'm going fast for you um you can identify a lot of missed opportunities you're going to be able to expose some of those templates you'll be able to understand the influence your crawling traffic has on your site and I'm actually going to skip this because I'm going to go to the stuff that actually matters so why does it matter because you can build views like this this one view okay has six opportunities for you to be able to explain from your strategic standpoint one you get an easy comparison of your discovered versus you're refreshed now you know whether or not you need to be spending more time on getting more access and availability to the bot two if you're not able to do that you can figure out that you have a crawl budget issue really simplistically the reason you can say that is look when we have refreshed and discovered down there's less traffic when they're up there's more traffic easy to populate very simple with the data that you've already pulled here indexing patterns over time the full stack is your index right so if you're only indexing at 65,000 and you want to be at 145,000 add one more stack to this make it empty put the dotted lines in and now you can show missed opportunity related to the traffic then you can project another line and say look at all the traffic we could get if you just let me index the whole site um there's quite a few other things you can do with this but realistically what I'm trying to do is give you guys tools so that you can make an impact by doing less with what you've got and I know that that sounds crazy right do less so these are some example insights that you can Garner from what I just showed you um I already talked about it but I know a lot of people like things on the slides so that they can take the pictures and take it home so these are the tidbits there now here's another opportunity content hubs if it's red it's not good it's a dud if it's dark green it's a hub it's an opportunity you always wonder if people are going to sit here and do all this internal linking how do I increase my flow you build a map and you can see the little spots where you can actually create better connectivity really quickly th this is from screaming frog any any anime fans no all right mashall we got to get strong with it did I make my time I did it I did it thank you thank you [Applause]",
        "cleaned_text": "all right guys jr told me to do this so that you would all wake up and pay attention to me who wants a tshirt okay so thats not embarrassing at all i know right im oprah up in here oprah seo yeah so i am im going to talk about chasing the googlebot trail and im pretty sure everybodys like what does that mean uh i speak mostly about crawling the reason i speak about crawling the most is because its the most important part of seo i said that because many of you are like our jobs dont rely on crawling jewelry and im like yes it does its where your strategies should start for everything so thats what im going to talk about first were going to talk about google search console and the tools you can use in there we are going to talk about entry points and weve talked about log files things like that so everybody here knows what an entry point is its where googles coming into the site were fixing technical difficulties while im doing this uh i dont know if youve ever built a crawl map but part of the google bot trail that im talking about is understanding how google enters navigates and understands your website but as seos you guys have heard a lot of stuff today about proving our points measurement and being able to explain ourselves technical seos suffer from this the most right were trying to get budget were trying to work with engineering were trying to work within marketing sometimes we have to deal with product then we have analytics and the list goes on and on but we talk about it from like an enterprise perspective and sometimes a midium a midgrade perspective and sometimes for small sites i want to talk about it from the perspective that you should be able to do things manually you should be able to do things with tools or without tools and use whatever you do have because lets be honest not everybody has access to server logs so im going to be able to tell you guys about you know taking some of that data turning it into strategy after you map everything out and how to use these maps that you get from all these tools because having tools for the sake of using them doesnt help anybody mike already talked about me uh so first like crawl stats right you guys are like jory that was out in 2020 we all know about them its not a big deal but for a lot of people it is because youre working with clients who maybe they dont have access to their server logs or if you want to expedite your point and get them to do what you need them to do they need to see immediate response and they need you to take action on it something we can all get access to is crawl stats so its an easy way to not necessarily get all the logs but actually make your point about why you need them so yeah i made it a little bit dramatic but the reason its so dramatic is i said this before crawling is the most important you want to know why i think crawling is the most important other than you know google cant access anything without it if you if you went to the google docs and youre using the developer tools right and youre reading everything what percentage do you think crawling takes up of the google documentation that they give to developers and technologist like us if you take away structured data it makes up 70 of the content provided so 70 right i think thats pretty important then that we focus on crawling so the stats report im going to go briefly into it give you some highlights about ways to use it little tidbits you can pull out from it not too detailed but if youve seen it you go to the settings most of you have seen it okay good good good like 20 of the room i dont know what the rest of you back there are using but its okay all right so crawl stats are going to give us things like the crawl requests how many times googles trying to visit and download things the download size how big are the page is you know not a big deal things that i really think are going to be important your average uh oh your average response time sorry and then the other thing that i think isnt that important but is is going to be your host status so total crawl requests how many people think that more requests is better okay so four people five five people in the room think more requests is better so you think being crawled less is good the rest of the room exactly it depends so a lot of times what youll find is you come up against questions like well what do we want to do with our crawl budget and why do we need all these requests and why are you asking us for logs and why does this matter and the thing is is theres no specific answer you cant say well more requests is better or you know less requests is good but what you can do is help people understand how do we model around the requests that we want and thats one of the things im going to talk about is how do we get to a place where we can explain what it is we want how many requests we should expect and then what do we do if we dont get them and what do we do when we are more adjustments okay so part of what i tend to do and like i said im going to go through manually being able to do things using tools and some of you who are pretty you know apt to scripting theres going to be somebody talking tomorrow about building out your own app scripts ive done quite a few tools here that i use if you see a tool that you like or i tell you hey i built an appscript for that its absolutely okay to find me later and say hey can i get access to that absolutely you can but one of the things that we want to make sure when were looking at these craw requests download your data regularly okay theres no easy way to export this data theres no api thats going to give it to you so youre going to have to do it manually unless you want to break google rules and find a way to automat automatically do it with a macro i would never do anything like that okay but if you do and you need to like get that data out of there you you do what you got to do um one of the other things that youre going to want to look at your xml sitemaps those are your money pages ive seen xml sit maps that are filled with trash but we as seos know we cultivate those to target the things that are specific so you you should have an xml sitemap count thats matching the requests that you have your indexation count okay if your xml sitemap is supposed to be your goal right thats the gold and then you have indexation thats less than that you are not me meeting your goal if your call requests do not match that freak see what i did there okay not everybody some of youre not there yet but thats okay um but if its not matching one of the things you want to know is where do i dig into these kinds of reports are going to let us know that right the counts arent right so how do we know how long thats supposed to take im going to show you one of my my actual clients i filtered out a bunch of stuff but they came to me with an indexation problem that they didnt know was an indexation problem because what they told me was we have a really big site and i was like whats really big and theyre like you know like hundreds of thousands of euros and i was like its not that big its its fine theyre like but jory we have like 150000 urls that are supposed to be in the index and i said who told you theyre supposed to be and theyre like our other seo and i was like get rid of that guy got me right but im silly if you cant tell um one of the things that i told him is you know im going to give myself a deadline to help you guys out so i looked at their xml sitemap i asked them are these your money money pages theyre like yeah these are the money pages i look at the indexation you guys see theres 65000 there so theres theres probably a gap right around 880000 urls are missing you guys see this number 49 when you guys do your quick mental math how many of you guys were like its going to take 11 days to get the rest in there because at the crawl rate that we have we got 10000 being in there the distribution is 7 to3 so yeah 11 days should get us at you know 7000 discovered urls if you thought 11 days your math is wrong uh its not your fault you do know how to do math but this is recursive right were going to have to take the amount that we newly discover and move them over into the ones that are getting reindexed and so i built a tool for that because im too lazy to do it manually on my own and the estimated time i gave them was i was like in around 50 days i can get you fully indexed okay thats very powerful as a technical seo to be able to give someone a deadline tell them why and how youre going to do it and tell them where the problem area is before you even ask them can i get access to your crawl logs can i get your engineers to do something for me youre already proving your value and your worth so total download size i actually dont care about this metric at all um i think its valuable if you see that the bot is getting

thats when i expect you to dig a little deeper into this metric but im not actually going to go into that metric very much because its its mostly inconsequential average response time most people are going to look at this and think time to first bite because what do we think right we send the message the bite hits the server responds bam they get the bite back and most of us consider that time to first bite if you actually look at the definition that google gives you in search console its not time to first bite they actually expect the last bite to be included and theyre ignoring a bunch of other things so its mostly the html that theyre looking at referencing now we talked about automation and tools and everything like that one of the things that i found is that no matter which way you slice this data and explain it to your customer or client google search console will never give you the actual data to be able to figure out how they do their average response time if you use any external tools youre probably going to have a problem there too you want to know why because google bot is crawling from where its choosing to crawl and hitting your servers wherever theyre at so the times dont match now im going to give you one of those tidbits that i told you ill ill drop little nuggets that you guys might like this is what i use and the reason i use this uh dom content load and yes i know for everybody thats a technologist whos thinking right now jory that doesnt come from the server you are correct its the browser side but its an identical metric served from the browser and that event fires right after your time to first buite in your page load so after your server response dom content load happens the event triggers so youre going to be within like micro milliseconds of your actual time is that accurate i havent been up here for 48 minutes you didnt reset my time uh so one of the things ill tell you is its okay to use this i actually got chewed out in the google forums for saying this but its true ive tested it multiple times against the average response rate thats actually delivered in search console and this is the thing thats going to most accurately match it so if youre going to take anything away empower yourselves you can do this from the browser side and show your customers right in their face these are the load responses and issues that were having this is why your average response time is important why its down and lets you know get some things going people like real data real time host status i told you i really dont care about this one um but

to understand how googles crawling and getting in and the referral urls so things that youre going to need to be able to do this again i wrote an appscript to do this because im too lazy and i use chat gpt um but your discovery and refresh reports these are those reports that i told you you do not want to use a macro to automatically download out of google search console because its against googles rules um your access logs again optional use google search console if you need to your xml sitemap report this is that thing that i told you is where all your money pages are your un url inspection report i access this through google search consoles api how many people use the api to regularly access the data awesome those of you who are not the people who raise their hands are being very very smart heres why theyre being very very smart when you use the api you get more access to the same views that youre getting in search console but you dont have the ability to capture or go backwards in time youll get those data points at any any point in time because you can actually reference the dates send that back and get it delivered to you so i think its very important for you to use search console if you dont know how to use the api ask me for the script go to cloud console activate it and then you can use this very easily then the backlinks report go atrs um i think that if you dont understand what backlinks you have youre going to have a really hard time understanding some of the referral urls that youre getting the traffic from these are actually more important than most people think because we talk a lot about our internal linking but the assumption with internal linking is googles already gotten there one of the things that ive noticed in search console thats you know great especially out of url inspection but very difficult to do at scale if youre not using the api is how do you identify which backlinks are valuable to you versus not when you use this tool youll get a table that spews out like this beautifully presented to keep it really simple and this is for your client as well as you but its going to tell you which urls are getting that activity so your entry paths and it already parses out which backlinks are sending them things like that in your referral urls the table was too big to span the whole screen so theres a lot that we could scroll left to but i cant today um so youll get your discovered url distribution youre going to get uh your ref your refresh the xml and and all of this good stuff now why do i think that this kind of a table is important to you this is easy to share with your customer but its also easy for you to utilize to figure out where to dig deep one of the problems here that youll look at that first year thats money right like that looks great i got eight back links everything good is happening if youre wondering why it says yourdomaincom thats what i replace my clients domain with but i can see the crawl data i can see that the page is okay i can see that its being refreshed i can see that its in my index so i know that thats right now what youre going to look for is the flags where things arent the way that you plann this is why i said its all part of your strategy if your strategy is to get somebody deeper into the website into a category page you pop everything in here and your category pages have a couple of these nos you already know theres something wrong with the category pages now i need to investigate the entry mapping to those go in to the ural index report again and find out does it have backlinks yes or no if it doesnt have backlinks you might need a new entry point does it have internal links yes or no now you know the easy solutions to figuring out how to navigate and one once again easily presenting the information getting somebody to use it quickly and not having a problem you can also do this manually i dont suggest it thats why i wrote the appscript but all of these can be exported manually and you can do the exact exa same thing especially if you have a smaller site so i dont know if you guys have picked up on this yet but im a little lazy so im going to talk about multiple ways to do this but im probably going to tell you the laziest way tools tasks and tactics you got to use the right tools or bad things happen i saw you laugh its funny i know uh so weve got a lot of tools in fact theres a lot of tools here and im actually going to talk about a couple of them that are here today because theyre great tools for helping you map out this crawl map the thing that the crawl map is supposed to help you understand entry points yes blockage points opportunity points as well its hard to see when youre doing enterprise search if you got a million eurs can you really find the one little spot where everythings getting bogged down absolutely not but what these m can help you with is figuring out which templates which themes which areas and access points arent available so screaming frog i put it first not because its the best tool i love screaming frog and its a great tool i put it first because its the most accessible tool thats going to give you the tools that you need and their log analyzer is lovely you get some okay graphics its free so if youre not familiar with logs and you dont want to understand whether or not youre going to have to filter parse and fix them this is a great opportunity for you to use a free tool see how you feel about the log files and decide whether or not youre going to use logs or ask for them at all because a lot of times nobody wants to give you access anyway secondly things that i love about the tool you can pretty much filter data any way you imagine okay and the reason thats powerful is were not working at one url at a time were working on url patterns when you filter you can get to a pattern faster other things that i really like is that its really simple right this looks like what i build in my excel spreadsheets all by myself so i feel comfortable with that a lot of executives are comfortable with that too so its not that big of a deal now things that arent great if you need to rasle dazzle your client this is not the tool that youre going to pull the pictures from and be like look what i did boss its not that great if your logs are malformed and what that means is if the log lines are not coming in and theyre getting bundled if you have regular expressions that are getting fed in by you know black bots um its not going to clean that up for you and theres not really an easy way to do that you have to figure that out on your own and then it can be a little much right if its your first time using the tool and youre not trying to overanalyze its going to give you a lot more than you expect so if you are that kind of person where you want it a little simpler you want the visuals and everything else i i love jet octopus for this um its got some great benefits they do have a free trial i actually talked to serge and he told me to tell you that its seven days but if you came to this conference for limited time only its 14 days for you too um he did say that for real i i swear um but things that are phenomenal very easy to see things are grouped very well you going and give me the time all right i got to go faster guys you let me talk too slow uh it supports multiple data sources so if youre working enterprise earlier you might have heard philly say you got to pay attention to where the logs are coming from yep cdn itll let you pull in aws itll let you pull in all your local logs if you have them in data dog you can pull in so its great you can also set up custom monitoring which i think is phenomenal things that arent so great you know its it costs money um if you dont have deep engineering experience or access you need a devops person to be able to implement this correctly when its implemented correctly flawless but if if its not its going to be some work that team is really willing to do that work with you though the other thing is it takes a learning curve so if you are not about adoption and you are not trying to advocate its its going to be a tool thats more robust than everybody can use and you wont be able to train them on it thats the manual downloads that i dont do with macros you can do this too uh manual charting which i i wont do but you can draw these and you can draw these conclusions and show people these the thing thats not going to be so great youre not going to be able to hit those nodes really quickly am i going fast enough now um all right so i told you manual i told you tools this is the middle of the road i bet you guys know what im going to say i built a tool that did this for me in abs scripts and i used chat gpt i actually did um and the thing is is its not beautiful but like not every tool is beautiful its not perfect but the thing is is you can customize things the way that you want so one of the things i did is i customized heat mapping into the nodes so that i can pull them out really easily so i dont actually pay attention to any of the noise except for the little dark blobs um hey its true so anybody a fan here i made this one myself so im very very proud of my third eye uh so now that weve gazed into the multiverse and everybody knows whats going on how can you use some of the stuff that i gave you and this is the stuff ill go through really fast but its the most important stuff for you so im glad im going fast for you um you can identify a lot of missed opportunities youre going to be able to expose some of those templates youll be able to understand the influence your crawling traffic has on your site and im actually going to skip this because im going to go to the stuff that actually matters so why does it matter because you can build views like this this one view okay has six opportunities for you to be able to explain from your strategic standpoint one you get an easy comparison of your discovered versus youre refreshed now you know whether or not you need to be spending more time on getting more access and availability to the bot two if youre not able to do that you can figure out that you have a crawl budget issue really simplistically the reason you can say that is look when we have refreshed and discovered down theres less traffic when theyre up theres more traffic easy to populate very simple with the data that youve already pulled here indexing patterns over time the full stack is your index right so if youre only indexing at 65000 and you want to be at 145000 add one more stack to this make it empty put the dotted lines in and now you can show missed opportunity related to the traffic then you can project another line and say look at all the traffic we could get if you just let me index the whole site um theres quite a few other things you can do with this but realistically what im trying to do is give you guys tools so that you can make an impact by doing less with what youve got and i know that that sounds crazy right do less so these are some example insights that you can garner from what i just showed you um i already talked about it but i know a lot of people like things on the slides so that they can take the pictures and take it home so these are the tidbits there now heres another opportunity content hubs if its red its not good its a dud if its dark green its a hub its an opportunity you always wonder if people are going to sit here and do all this internal linking how do i increase my flow you build a map and you can see the little spots where you can actually create better connectivity really quickly th this is from screaming frog any any anime fans no all right mashall we got to get strong with it did i make my time i did it i did it thank you thank you applause",

        "raw_text": "thank you thank you so the second day you a bit tired and now is the time for tortures with numbers in my presentation so please sit don't go out all my presentation have uh two words for big websites so everything about big websites I assume like 100 K pages and more so I'm not an SEO guy unfortunately I'm a developer but all my how much about like four many years of experience I was near SEO like they sitting near me and I believe it gives me the opportunity to understand both world how SEO thinks how developer thinks and uh during like during the building of jet octopus like te platform the two biggest Heche what I had it's JavaScript crawler and Google search console integration and I will tell you why so we love GSC right it's number one tool ala shows us in research and it's particularly like holy grow and if Indiana Jones will be in SEO world he for sure stole Google search console from us so but in the beginning let's zoom out a little bit from like particular Google search console and take a look what we have as a data for our technical SEO it's like three pillars of our data source it should be forth pillar as well with conversion with user traction etc etc G4 but everybody hates it and I decided to not put it here so just just three pillars of technical Soo data okay so what craw is actually CW gives us site structure okay so the next step after craw we have Logs with scraw budget right so how Google bot perceives our website and the third part is is Google search console it's one of the main like things here because it goes like a funnel let's say so in craw we have all our factors with internal linking how like unlocks our craw budget what's scroll what not and of course impression how connects all those things between together it's a factors first of all so how your internal linking impact your craw budget what craws what not how your craw budget impacts on your rankings as well does it mean so when you your C budget increase your traffic increase is it true but maybe yes maybe no somewhere sometimes no completely and uh again like what we talked like yesterday it was in presentation uh like talking with your C Level is like crucial things and with your technical team with many stakeholders so three data sets gives us opportunity to like draw a simple chart from creation of page on a website till the end getting organic clicks our most important metric like mostly most important metric in the end so it is when we say in Google search console your first picture in mind like this so it's what search console like exactly we all know it it's very cool a lot of features but when we talk about big websites our Google search console is this so we have API and we have to use it because we know like an interface only thousands of lines in export Etc and if you compare like get VI on the list of methods what we have here site analytics sitemap sites eural inspection that's it it's no scroll here it's basically all API what we have like nothing particular we have what we have and like maybe if Google heard us so please like gives us more methods in API we will be very like thankful for you but anyway we need only one method but like in this case you like Ural inspection is uh as well very fine but for our analytics needs we need only one method query so the signature of a method com has uh like a few fields we will not go you check the documentation we have important parameters and additional parameters so I believe even without my description you realize that what it what they do start date end date and dimensions it's like the basic thing what you can do with them like 90% of your job one of the another very interesting parameters agregation type pay special attention to it it's how do you how it will return your impressions like a few words here if your website has like two t it's two times on a Ser if aggregation type by property you will have only one impression if aggregation type by Page will have two Impressions because it's like literally it was two times on S page even simultaneously and type it's like search Google News Etc so what we have in as the results four fields that everybody knows and understands and loves I believe okay so now is the time to make our first query I hope you're ready so we like for the previous months for September let's just pull the data from 1 of September till 30 of September without any Dimension just you know the simplest thing what we can do okay and we get the results I like store it as Excel file so extremely understandable nothing fancy here one of key take if you want to have a key take away from my whole presentation here it is so by working with any type of data any type of data source don't trust it don't don't trust it even don't trust you know to me or whatever like critical thinking is one of important you know thinking our I don't know nowadays let's say let's verify it so how we can be sure so okay we have our table and we have screenshot from Google search conso like extremely correct awesome nice okay but looking on this data what we can do with it we already have it in search console just for reporting right since we are Tech doing technical SEO we need URL a URL of a page so we'll make our second query we adding into Dimension a page so as the results we have the same Excel but with one more colume URL so what does it mean we have URL and for each URL the data and we have to verify it so what's inside let's scroll down okay so it's one of the most simplest action what we can do we scroll down and I if you don't see from the from the last rows we have about 14 case of P of rows of pages like and indexed Pages almost 19 Bill Millions so do we have I don't know what type of website can produce you know every page how many Impressions it it will has so do we need do did we do some uh mistake in our query but no it was very simple so what's the conclusion Google lies to us isn't it okay so the next thing what we wanted to work usually it's a query from Google search console again we just adding just one parameter to our Dimension so after page we add in query as a result we have URL and now we have query you can clearly see here is a brand in traffic like branded queries in the like top of Impressions you can clearly see with low ctrs by branded query sets PPC going on so PPC simply taking all clicks for your branding queries and you simply like throw money uh out of the window oh it's a s conference I can say this way okay so again time to verify it we scroll down and we have 444k K rows so it's not pages right now because every row it's a Page Plus query okay so how many URLs we have here someone has an idea like 50k 100K who gives more like 260k URLs it's the same website by the way I didn't change the we so we're talking about the same website same property everything's the same so how many URLs has been ranked in September again it's Google search console it's not third party tool tool you know what's going on here and let's make a table like to sum up to have understanding so we have number of URLs and the next thing what we wanted to verify is the number of Impressions and clicks our most like most required parameters again a lot of numbers here I promised it will be a lot of numbers but let's make it in percentage view by the total Dimension it's like 100% and now we're going by URL by query and you already see where our data Google gives us a data so in particular for impressions in the dimension eural query 26% from the whole data and the question what you have in mind right now why why it's going on and of course like well 10% of queries and uh examples of other websites it depend the number depending of a niche but the bigger the website is the L less data you have it's like Golden Rule how Google search console works and why does it work ah again I forget in like slides let's make things worse you for example want to have different like distinct numbers for mobile devices and for desktop devices and tablet so you make a separate queries for give me the data for mobiles plus tablet and give me the data for desktops okay you sum up and you have to have like the total amounts like the same but they're not you will have cases when URL has an impressions for mobile devices zero impressions for desktop and zero total why why and you have you will have the cases like for example like 15 Impressions total 24 mobiles 10 10 desktops again why the the same thing when you so we load the data by months but uh you wanted to have data like on a daily basis on weekly basis you started loading data on daily basis and you have completely different numbers in for the whole months so if it's some random function inside I don't know how does it work this API and why it happens of course is non one said before anonymized query it's very for me as a developer it's very interesting term so a traffic comes to comes to our website we have IP address we have like control with JavaScript we can have browser Footprints like other data source and we can deiz in the end user can register on our website and to buy you know in our Eco on our online shop things but Google doesn't want to give us the data some anonymization issues but okay even uh it's some reason which I can imagine why doesn't return data for Pages do we have anonymized Pages as well so what happens so if you analyze uh your top pages which has like thousands or Millions Impressions like per month per day whatever you're safe so it's the D data will be safe the data will be correct we verify many times different ways but the biggest problem is with longtail Pages like long low frequency queries which technical SEO loves particularly because it's very easy like field to to produce the results of your technical optimization like internal link and whatever it's like number one key Point what you can grow by action technical SEO and it was a bad news before okay and now time for bad news again it will be no good news here so it it doesn't exist unfortunately like complete solution it will be uh like hugs semi Solutions let's say and the number one what you can do it's subfolders you probably know it the idea is you may have like your main property like it could be the main property like wherever and you started to add in your subfolders what you have on your website I hope you have subfolders and you don't have completely flood structure on your URLs if you have them okay like maybe next time next project thousand properties you can add in your Google search account search console account do you think it's a lot trust me no we have clients with a few Google search like few Google accounts and thousand properties it's really okay when we're talking about size so don't think it's you have to add just five subfolders okay so it's the cons of this way it's very easy to do so like guys with laptops just open Google search console right now like click add property and you you know your like top sub folders your top categories like blog shop wherever what you have on your particular website simply copy it from your browser URL address and uh add it as URL prefix in your Google search console it will be already verified and uh it's just one click uh action by basically the problem is the data will be started to collect it right from this from the moment you add them so that's why I'm talking like do it right now do it tomorrow like day after tomorrow and forget about that like for a month for two so the same bulk export the data should accumulate here and the next like issue working with subfolders it's the working with the data so after a month you remember so you addit hundreds of sub folders and now time to put our hands on the data but if you see on our main property JC property one we have like a shop sub folder already and we add Ed shop subfolder so what does it mean shop subfolder it's presented in uh our 2 GSC properties and if you simply combine the data it will make your data duplication so you will have two times more Impressions Etc so it's not simply merge all the data what you have so the proper solution you have to remove subfolder data from the main property or simply work like within your sub folder it will be like easy to start so if you have some SEO tool usually they do in merging the subfolders DAT subfolders data if you wanted to merge it by yourself please not make it with AI please not make it because again I like my hair changing color because of subfolder merging as well it's really comp because you can add also Sub sub folders so you have to make threeway like data D duplication and it's very easy way to make things way worse after that let's check an example of our results what we did you know with subfolder so it's another website and here if I'm not mistaken about hundreds of subfolders added so in the main property we have just 80,000 pages right and after we added sub folders now more than 4 million Pages like amazing like growing Impressions like amount of clicks it's huge increase I wish we had 50 times more in our traffic increase you know not in pages but anyway like look how cool now it become right so why I didn't say like good news we don't have good news let's make the table again it's again 10% 18% so but it's on the it's a very big website one of the like top in us but in the results a key takeaway like working with Google search console and the data with API we can't make it better we can't make it ideal we have what we have here and we think is we have to understand how to to deal with this this flows of instruments what we have with data source what we have the word is not ideal and data as well so what does it mean by working especially with longtail query so because some SEO for example like talking about like pruning content like removing old content and by using data from GSC it's very easy just let's have a Pages what had which had like only one impression during the whole all last year and remove them like very easy right but in the reality it they can have not only one impression they can have 100 impression thousand impression but you simply don't have all the data so keep this in mind like all time when you're working with API so maybe you see only like part of the whole picture and don't make fast you know conclusions like is it going that way on other way and you may ask me like why I'm talking about API not about GSC bul data export and uh BK data experts we have it about 2 years right now and I was excited when it was released I like almost was ready you know start to develop integration in jet octopus with bul expert I just waited some big client you know come to us like okay we wanted to use our bul expert I'm still waiting two years past I'm still waiting who wants to integrate bu data expert in J octopus like whatever the problem is API is very convenient it's very easy to start is there are a lot of like integration with looker Studio a lot of tools like your own scripts it's very easy to start bul data experts very cool technology I like no complaints here but again it's not easy to integrate and when we're talking again with Enterprise websites all the security issues like configuring the Google buckets etc etc we had an experience when we waited just simple I am as a person I asked it for access to Google search console and I waited two months after security team will review my uh application and they will add to their Google search console me as a person and now we're talking about bul data expert so it's really cool technology but again API is simple we understand it it's a lot of materials it's a lot of tools what based on uh GC API and that's what we have and so no flows of API and uh I wish you the best thanks for them attention [Applause]",

ask me like why im talking about api not about gsc bul data export and uh bk data experts we have it about 2 years right now and i was excited when it was released i like almost was ready you know start to develop integration in jet octopus with bul expert i just waited some big client you know come to us like okay we wanted to use our bul expert im still waiting two years past im still waiting who wants to integrate bu data expert in j octopus like whatever the problem is api is very convenient its very easy to start is there are a lot of like integration with looker studio a lot of tools like your own scripts its very easy to start bul data experts very cool technology i like no complaints here but again its not easy to integrate and when were talking again with enterprise websites all the security issues like configuring the google buckets etc etc we had an experience when we waited just simple i am as a person i asked it for access to google search console and i waited two months after security team will review my uh application and they will add to their google search console me as a person and now were talking about bul data expert so its really cool technology but again api is simple we understand it its a lot of materials its a lot of tools what based on uh gc api and thats what we have and so no flows of api and uh i wish you the best thanks for them
