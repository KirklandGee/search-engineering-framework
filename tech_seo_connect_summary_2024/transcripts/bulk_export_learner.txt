00:00:11.559 thank
00:00:13.080 you who's ready for a
00:00:16.320 journey most of my decks are kind of
00:00:18.720 Journey decks I take you along for the
00:00:20.840 ride uh we're going to explore uh what I
00:00:24.039 learned building a tool right so the
00:00:26.240 bulk data export is something that I got
00:00:28.920 super stoked on a year and a half ago
00:00:31.279 because I was part of the small team
00:00:32.960 that developed that tool with Google um
00:00:36.559 they they got a lot of insight from a
00:00:39.000 small group of seos to help them develop
00:00:41.120 the tool I hadn't really worked with it
00:00:43.000 a lot and I've always had it in the back
00:00:45.480 of my mind as something that I wanted to
00:00:47.079 explore and work with more deeply and I
00:00:49.680 also had built a product called Branch
00:00:51.879 Explorer which uses Google search
00:00:54.160 console data coming out of the API and
00:00:57.559 it had some limitations because it was
00:00:59.320 only working with at the Web search type
00:01:01.559 and it was only Gathering 50,000 rows of
00:01:04.159 data per day and I always wanted to take
00:01:06.680 Branch Explorer and marry it together
00:01:09.439 with with this this Pipeline and so what
00:01:12.799 I wanted to
00:01:14.360 do why
00:01:19.840 is I know I gave him the right
00:01:23.240 file uh that's the best thing that's
00:01:26.320 ever happened uh
00:01:30.159 so uh what I wanted to do was to marry
00:01:32.600 the two together and I wanted to build a
00:01:35.479 really badass tool that LE see the thing
00:01:37.960 that's cool about the bulk data export
00:01:40.000 pipeline is that Google handles all the
00:01:41.759 engineering for you they push all the
00:01:44.200 data for you up into the cloud and that
00:01:47.399 makes it super easy from an engineering
00:01:49.960 perspective and I wanted to utilize that
00:01:53.280 data and push it into Branch Explorer
00:01:56.159 which is a custom view of data and what
00:01:59.159 y'all are going to get out of this is
00:02:01.039 actually your own free Branch Explorer
00:02:04.000 tool and your own data pipelines that
00:02:07.159 you can use yourselves to look at search
00:02:09.479 console data at scale super badass right
00:02:13.599 and I love kangaroos that's not my slide
00:02:19.840 uh someone asked
00:02:24.040 me why it's hard I can't believe this
00:02:26.720 I'm being broadcast to YouTube uh uh so
00:02:29.640 I just want to say hi to Joy Hawkins
00:02:31.800 who's probably watching this right now
00:02:33.239 and I'm hoping that Marie Haynes is also
00:02:36.120 watching this because she gets a wicked
00:02:37.680 call out and I also want to take an
00:02:39.800 opportunity here to have you guys take
00:02:42.239 some notes this next piece is not part
00:02:44.319 of my deck but I want you to write down
00:02:47.360 these three words as the most important
00:02:49.720 thing you're going to learn at this
00:02:51.080 conference
00:02:52.599 make me
00:02:55.640 smarter I want all of us to embrace
00:02:58.720 those three words of as we make our way
00:03:00.959 throughout the world there have been
00:03:02.920 plenty times today and yesterday where
00:03:05.239 I've been completely blown away by what
00:03:08.640 I'm seeing on stage and I felt less
00:03:12.480 than not as smart as not as experienced
00:03:16.959 as has anyone felt that
00:03:18.760 way we're all on a journey together
00:03:21.840 right and this is my knowledge right and
00:03:26.680 when I watched Kristen tinsky talk today
00:03:30.200 I was feeling like oh my
00:03:33.720 God like her knowledge is so much bigger
00:03:37.000 than mine but the thing is that for all
00:03:39.680 of us all of our sets of knowledge are
00:03:42.239 tangential and overlapping so like just
00:03:44.840 keep in mind as you're making a way and
00:03:47.040 as you're on your journey learning all
00:03:48.640 of this stuff like if your boss sent you
00:03:51.360 here to learn Tech SEO in a conference
00:03:55.480 right like it's really hard to learn all
00:03:58.560 this stuff and you just have to commit
00:04:01.079 yourself to the journey of
00:04:03.000 learning while they figure it out can I
00:04:05.159 ask you a couple questions please do so
00:04:08.079 you also have a SEO Community which I
00:04:10.079 forgot to mention yeah how would you
00:04:12.640 recommend people getting involved in
00:04:14.519 that okay so the tech excuse me the seoc
00:04:18.680 community.com
00:04:20.320 right it's if you go to that website
00:04:23.360 you'll see that there's a page called
00:04:25.639 apply and you apply with your name email
00:04:29.039 and your link D profile that helps us
00:04:31.400 vet that you're a real human being which
00:04:33.560 is kind of important there are about
00:04:35.520 3,200 other marketers a lot of folks who
00:04:38.800 are here are members and moderators
00:04:41.639 Mike's a moderator of our testing
00:04:43.600 Channel Kristen's a moderator of our AI
00:04:47.639 uh AI for SEO Channel and I think it's
00:04:50.520 an amazing Place uh I took a huge amount
00:04:54.160 of um inspiration for what AR did with
00:04:57.240 women and Tech SEO and I just thought
00:05:00.919 that um when Twitter fell apart I really
00:05:03.560 wanted to not have to look for my
00:05:06.160 friends right like I didn't want to do
00:05:08.120 Mastadon I didn't want to do blue sky I
00:05:10.320 didn't know where to look and slack just
00:05:12.560 felt like the smartest way to go Okay
00:05:15.479 and like I said you've done so many
00:05:18.000 videos with agency automats and so on
00:05:21.039 and there's people in here when we talk
00:05:22.520 about automation it's like it's cool but
00:05:25.000 they don't know where to start and I
00:05:26.000 know you're going to talk about that to
00:05:27.080 some degree here yeah but if you're
00:05:28.720 someone coming into this for the first
00:05:31.319 time yeah where would you recommend that
00:05:33.199 they start uh appscript Google Sheets
00:05:36.240 functions to appscript to
00:05:39.080 JavaScript or you could take an
00:05:40.919 alternate path which goes appscript to
00:05:43.199 python uh python is a much easier
00:05:46.120 language to learn the JavaScript who's
00:05:48.440 afraid of learning python anyone does it
00:05:50.960 sound hard does it sound like only smart
00:05:54.120 people do it it is literally the easiest
00:05:57.000 programming language to learn period
00:05:59.680 like the things that are hard about it
00:06:01.360 are like managing
00:06:03.919 indentations like how many spaces do I
00:06:06.680 put right and then also getting packages
00:06:09.599 to work together yeah of course of
00:06:11.360 course but from my perspective anyone
00:06:14.400 can code now because of large language
00:06:16.240 models right you as long as you can
00:06:18.160 describe what you want it's going to
00:06:21.240 give you some okay code and if it breaks
00:06:25.000 then you just put the error in and then
00:06:26.639 it fixes it yeah except for like and I'm
00:06:31.520 going to get into that in the deck but
00:06:33.080 like I basically built I built a data
00:06:36.440 Pipeline and I only used AI to build it
00:06:39.840 and I wanted to know if it was possible
00:06:41.440 to build software applications just
00:06:43.360 using do you guys want my
00:06:46.039 laptop we got it okay um I don't believe
00:06:50.199 you I think they Del I think they
00:06:51.840 deleted my deck I think they by accident
00:06:54.199 deleted it um but
00:06:59.800 yeah like what I found was that when I
00:07:01.319 built something that was creating
00:07:03.720 JavaScript it was throwing natural
00:07:05.840 language into the code so instead of
00:07:08.160 like doing end end to equal a and b it
00:07:13.280 would say a and then the word and and B
00:07:17.160 and I was just feeling and I threw that
00:07:19.400 into itself to fix it and it couldn't
00:07:22.039 figure out the error that was that was
00:07:25.400 um chat that was that was claw no that
00:07:28.360 was uh chat GPT
00:07:32.080 4.0 so people think that Claude Sonet is
00:07:37.000 like the best one for writing code I
00:07:39.440 enjoy it a lot and I use it with cursor
00:07:42.080 and I use it with another tool called
00:07:43.759 ader Aid D
00:07:46.479 eer we're going to talk about that as we
00:07:50.560 go um this is the first time I've ever
00:07:54.000 had a deck completely disappear it's
00:07:56.759 there it's the combination of
00:08:01.000 Adobe PDFs and Google Slides huh window
00:08:06.039 and windows also oh Windows yeah yeah
00:08:09.360 have we solved the problem though all
00:08:11.800 right
00:08:13.120 cool I could
00:08:15.020 [Laughter]
00:08:20.080 tell how you doing no I'm good I'm
00:08:22.960 having fun yeah you know I actually like
00:08:25.680 when things go wrong cuz it's like you
00:08:27.199 get the opportunity to see what you can
00:08:28.759 do in the moment
00:08:30.039 so I think we're good now though so I'm
00:08:31.919 I'm going to try this again everybody
00:08:33.039 make some noise for noer
00:08:36.080 y' this is
00:08:39.080 amazing okay so we're going to go in on
00:08:41.599 a journey I'm going to share all kinds
00:08:43.519 of stuff that I learned building a
00:08:46.200 really cool tool that you guys will get
00:08:47.880 access to for free I'm going to share a
00:08:49.600 ton of Lessons Learned I'm also going to
00:08:52.519 share a couple custom gpts that I built
00:08:55.800 for you keep in mind all of the slides
00:08:59.079 are available to you so you're going to
00:09:00.959 have them all after so you don't have to
00:09:02.839 like race cuz I have a whole bunch of QR
00:09:05.320 codes that are flashing up on screen but
00:09:08.279 you can scan them you know when you get
00:09:09.959 back to back wherever you're going okay
00:09:12.720 so what's the mashup we're building
00:09:15.040 something with the GSC bulk export and
00:09:17.800 we're building something with Explorer
00:09:20.800 Explorer is a looker Studio based
00:09:23.399 product that we built that allows you to
00:09:25.279 look at search console data at scale
00:09:27.360 it's got all kinds of Time series visual
00:09:29.600 ations tables it'll allow you to see
00:09:32.320 stuff that you haven't seen before and
00:09:35.519 we only Built it with this mashup using
00:09:38.279 AI who knows Dave
00:09:40.399 sodano I saw him speak at Tech SEO boost
00:09:44.279 in
00:09:45.160 2019 and uh he blew me away and he blew
00:09:48.360 me away because he was like the guy on
00:09:52.480 stage talking about JavaScript and I
00:09:55.040 think he even dropped the words
00:09:57.279 python in his deck which I thought was
00:10:00.160 amazing and he's been a hero of mine a
00:10:02.200 mentor collaborator for a super long
00:10:04.640 time so when I got the opportunity to
00:10:07.800 speak here we had a call together and I
00:10:09.600 said hey Dave I'm thinking about
00:10:10.880 building this thing what do you think
00:10:13.600 and he said oh dude it's awesome it's
00:10:15.560 amazing you should totally do it
00:10:16.760 everybody's going to eat it up it's
00:10:17.800 going to be so cool and then he said
00:10:19.959 this within six months this was two
00:10:22.720 months ago I promise you anyone can
00:10:25.279 build anything with an llm um let's see
00:10:28.480 if he's right
00:10:30.079 and when he said that I thought he was
00:10:31.720 totally crazy because if you think about
00:10:33.480 the technology adoption curve it looks a
00:10:35.600 lot like
00:10:36.880 this I feel like this is Kristen people
00:10:40.760 like Kristen this is me this is a whole
00:10:43.800 bunch of us in the room this is
00:10:47.600 generalist folk doing marketing these
00:10:50.600 are consumers these are our parents
00:10:54.040 right okay and so when Dave said anyone
00:10:57.279 could build anything I thought he was
00:10:59.000 saying that this person could build
00:11:01.519 something within 6 months and that's why
00:11:03.160 I thought he was so super crazy okay and
00:11:07.720 what do we know about the bulk export
00:11:09.680 what is it well it's basically three
00:11:11.200 things there's three tables that get
00:11:13.440 pushed up into big query the first one's
00:11:15.160 called the export log second one is the
00:11:17.399 URL impression table third one is the
00:11:20.399 site level data sight level data is
00:11:22.720 where it's just aggregating all the me
00:11:24.600 metrics for you at the query level the
00:11:27.279 URL impression table is aggregating
00:11:29.399 everything at the combination of query
00:11:32.360 and page and it's giving you all kinds
00:11:34.839 of other stuff too which we'll get into
00:11:37.160 um these are the kinds of fields that
00:11:38.880 are available inside the bulk export
00:11:41.760 again you're going to get access to this
00:11:43.120 in the slide this is coming straight out
00:11:44.800 of big query if you haven't seen this
00:11:47.360 before it's pretty cool specifically
00:11:50.720 that field is anonymized
00:11:54.440 query everybody's always super pissed
00:11:57.000 about what gets sampled right this gives
00:11:59.680 you the visibility to be able to see
00:12:02.440 which pages are getting anonymized
00:12:04.959 queries when I looked at our own data
00:12:07.560 what I saw was that all of the content
00:12:09.800 that we were building about how to use
00:12:11.880 Google uh user interfaces how to use
00:12:14.600 Google products those pages had
00:12:18.399 ridiculous quantities of anonymized
00:12:20.720 queries it was almost like Google didn't
00:12:23.279 want us to know how to compete with them
00:12:25.639 in the serers was how I was thinking
00:12:27.880 about it but also look at all these
00:12:29.360 Boolean Fields we've got is it a top
00:12:31.519 stories is it a Blue Link is it a job
00:12:33.560 listing job de details is it an action
00:12:37.839 is it an events listing is it is it an
00:12:40.320 amp is it video is it organic shopping
00:12:44.120 who does e-commerce who would like to
00:12:46.720 have that level of visibility about
00:12:48.399 their data right so these are the kinds
00:12:50.519 of things that are available to you when
00:12:52.760 you start working with the bulk export
00:12:55.160 um you've probably heard that it's
00:12:56.800 expensive right tons of data it's really
00:12:59.560 expensive we'll get into that um as
00:13:02.959 getting ready for the build of this I
00:13:04.880 didn't work with the site impression
00:13:06.600 table at all I just didn't have enough
00:13:09.199 time to do it um we've already talked
00:13:12.680 about all of the volume of data but this
00:13:15.399 is why there's so much you get data for
00:13:18.480 all countries so all your data is
00:13:20.519 segregated by country it's segregated by
00:13:23.480 all of the devices it's segregated by
00:13:26.079 all of the search types it's segregated
00:13:28.600 by all the search appearances which were
00:13:31.240 those Boolean fields that I shared in
00:13:33.000 the last slide um it's also giving you
00:13:35.639 information about Anonymous queries and
00:13:38.079 there's no row limits let's say you're
00:13:41.760 CNN.com or your Reddit uh you have it's
00:13:46.519 no longer 50,000 rows per day it's as
00:13:49.120 much as you want the fire hose is wide
00:13:51.120 open so for Enterprise sites it's super
00:13:53.920 super interesting what about a small
00:13:56.279 site is it interesting then too
00:13:59.240 yes and we'll get into that okay so all
00:14:02.519 search types so we get discover Google
00:14:04.440 news we get news we get image type we
00:14:06.920 get video we get web super dope and I
00:14:10.680 was also super stoked to build this
00:14:12.720 because I felt like there just weren't
00:14:14.399 any tools that I was aware of that's why
00:14:16.800 I have the bracket around the many piece
00:14:19.040 there just weren't a lot of tools for
00:14:20.839 specifically looking at data that was
00:14:23.079 coming out of the bulk export and um
00:14:26.680 with Explorer these are the types of
00:14:29.199 things that we do on top of the data
00:14:31.759 coming out of search console to make it
00:14:33.800 a lot easier to work with so we have
00:14:36.360 like your position with the bulk export
00:14:40.040 they're giving you position as a sum
00:14:42.680 they're not giving it to you as an
00:14:44.000 average position which is super annoying
00:14:46.360 you have to do the math yourself to
00:14:47.800 calculate you know the sum of position
00:14:50.240 by the number of Impressions to get to
00:14:51.839 an average position um so we do that
00:14:54.800 math for you uh click-through rate full
00:14:58.160 path which is is giving you almost like
00:15:00.880 the Google analytics view of your url um
00:15:04.160 we're also breaking it up into
00:15:06.040 subdirectory so we're giving you
00:15:07.440 insights as uh subdirectory level one 2
00:15:11.360 3 4 so if you have a site that has a
00:15:13.519 whole bunch of structure you're going to
00:15:15.279 really dig it um we're also giving you
00:15:18.360 all kinds of information around funnel
00:15:20.680 stages and the thing that I think you're
00:15:22.880 going to really dig is you can set the
00:15:24.920 Search terms in the tool that we give
00:15:27.519 you that align with your different
00:15:29.600 funnel stages which is super
00:15:32.120 badass uh let's see so you can see brand
00:15:34.959 versus non-brand funnel stage you can
00:15:37.160 see if a URL um happens to be something
00:15:40.240 that has UTM parameters that align with
00:15:42.800 GBP stuff which is super useful and you
00:15:46.800 can build URL segments has anyone ever
00:15:49.720 used
00:15:50.800 Bodify so in Bodify you've got a pretty
00:15:53.519 cool way of doing segmentation of your
00:15:56.199 else using whatever pattern you want I'm
00:15:59.040 not positive but I think they do it with
00:16:01.079 a case statement and what that means is
00:16:03.519 that a page can be a or it can be B but
00:16:07.399 it can't be
00:16:08.759 both boom we can do we can have Pages be
00:16:12.480 both so a page could be a Nike page
00:16:15.199 because it has Nike in the URL and it
00:16:17.519 could be a product detail page because
00:16:19.480 it has product in the string and it
00:16:22.160 could be a specific collection because
00:16:24.839 it has shoes in it right so you can have
00:16:28.199 one page be all kinds of different
00:16:30.160 segments which is pretty rad the other
00:16:33.600 thing that allows you to do is to see
00:16:35.240 directories pages and queries that are
00:16:37.720 driving change on our website I'm not
00:16:41.319 telling you how cool this is because
00:16:43.720 there's so much data it's not about the
00:16:46.800 volume of data it's about having a tool
00:16:49.959 that can help you get efficiently from
00:16:52.399 the hyack down to the needle and that's
00:16:55.519 why I've always been super jacked about
00:16:58.199 Explorer because I felt like it was the
00:17:00.319 best tool that I'd seen that enabled me
00:17:02.279 to do it and because the data is all in
00:17:04.480 big query if you've ever used looker
00:17:06.199 studio and if you use native connectors
00:17:08.799 and you're like this sucks it's super
00:17:11.319 slow especially if you have to blend
00:17:12.919 data together you're going to love using
00:17:14.919 it because of how fast it is okay so I'm
00:17:17.760 going to build something with AI what
00:17:19.439 could possibly go wrong right has anyone
00:17:22.280 ever struggled with chat GPT okay so
00:17:25.720 here's my approach to building tools
00:17:28.199 I've learned a lot talking to a lot of
00:17:30.600 folks in the room about how to do stuff
00:17:33.360 I generally focus on this sweet spot in
00:17:35.960 the VIN diagram I'm looking for stuff
00:17:38.080 that's fast to build easy to code and
00:17:41.799 super cheap to own hopefully free so I
00:17:45.080 build on the Google Cloud infrastructure
00:17:47.720 generally um I always focus on
00:17:50.760 painkillers not vitamins any aspiring
00:17:54.440 product people in the room and you've
00:17:58.039 ever thought to yourself like hey it'd
00:17:59.480 be really cool if I could show blah blah
00:18:01.799 blah that's a vitamin A painkiller is
00:18:05.240 how do I save 100 hours for my agency
00:18:07.720 this month right like that's the stuff
00:18:09.840 that I always focus on they also help us
00:18:12.559 as an agency smooth out capacity
00:18:14.559 challenges as we grow in scale this
00:18:17.960 helps us kind of deal with those
00:18:20.000 capacity changes um last year we had a
00:18:22.960 whole bunch of folks that went out on
00:18:24.600 paternity and maternity to leave we
00:18:26.840 found that all the automations that we
00:18:28.400 put in Place helped us deal with that
00:18:30.320 really really well they also help us be
00:18:33.480 really really sticky with our clients
00:18:36.280 when we can solve problems for our
00:18:38.080 clients in ways that other people can't
00:18:40.679 we've got a huge leg up and I don't know
00:18:42.960 if you've heard about Sterling sky but
00:18:44.799 we're in the local space and we're
00:18:46.840 generally known as kind of the Premier
00:18:48.679 local agency in North America uh this is
00:18:52.320 the stack that I use I started with
00:18:54.480 Google app script I was talking with
00:18:56.360 whoops I was talking with Mike about
00:18:58.240 that
00:18:59.360 how do you go backwards it's not going
00:19:01.799 backwards okay um I started with Google
00:19:05.120 app script and then from there I
00:19:08.200 actually had an agency automator with
00:19:11.000 Dave sodano where he taught me how to do
00:19:12.840 Cloud functions and I thought it was the
00:19:14.240 coolest thing because Cloud functions
00:19:16.640 allow you to have a million invocations
00:19:19.960 for free per month I was like holy
00:19:22.440 that's such a big number like I can do
00:19:25.159 so many cool things with that and I work
00:19:27.039 with apis I also use use um fir store
00:19:30.919 specifically to manage State and that's
00:19:33.919 like storing client variables storing
00:19:36.600 information that I need to read and
00:19:38.200 write a lot and I also use big query
00:19:41.760 like crazy and looker studio for
00:19:44.360 visualization to me if you're trying to
00:19:46.919 figure out what your Tech stack should
00:19:48.960 look like I think this is a great place
00:19:51.360 to start you could totally you could
00:19:54.000 totally um get rid of firestore and use
00:19:57.120 postgress um as another database tech
00:20:00.000 there but I think this is a great great
00:20:01.880 way to think about things when I used to
00:20:03.760 build I built exclusively in vs code for
00:20:06.720 two to four years and when co-pilot came
00:20:10.480 out I was super super jacked when you're
00:20:13.240 thinking about Automation and you're
00:20:15.000 thinking about AI in coding co-pilot is
00:20:18.760 the best way to dip your toes in and the
00:20:21.080 reason why is that when you're working
00:20:22.720 with co-pilot it's basically like you'll
00:20:25.760 start typing and it'll finish the line
00:20:27.919 of code for it you hit Tab and you just
00:20:30.520 move on and so it's not like chat GPT
00:20:33.280 where you're like saying hey build me a
00:20:34.720 whole function that does X and it spits
00:20:36.960 out 400 lines of code and you have no
00:20:39.039 idea what's broken this gives you like a
00:20:41.320 very limited way to get started um I
00:20:44.080 loved it I loved it I loved it I loved
00:20:46.840 it um and then I went to Canada and I
00:20:51.360 met Marie Haynes in person I don't know
00:20:53.640 if you've ever spent any time with her
00:20:55.240 but I had one of the most compelling
00:20:57.760 come to Jesus talks I've ever had with
00:21:00.080 any human ever where she told me I was
00:21:02.640 doing everything wrong and all I needed
00:21:05.080 to do in life was learn more about Ai
00:21:07.200 and use it and I was like you Marie
00:21:10.480 and I went home all angry and I made
00:21:14.679 some changes uh I started to use chat
00:21:17.200 GPT at that point this was in October of
00:21:19.840 last year and I started learning about
00:21:22.240 all the things that have to do with this
00:21:24.840 stuff okay tokens a token is a chunk of
00:21:29.760 words or images or text it's really
00:21:32.600 small it's like four characters um in
00:21:36.120 English each token is like 3/4 of a word
00:21:39.279 right context window you're going to
00:21:41.360 hear this all the time a context window
00:21:44.360 is this is basically a measurement of
00:21:46.200 the size of information that can go in
00:21:48.880 and out of a large language model and as
00:21:52.120 these technologies have improved context
00:21:54.960 Windows have become larger so when you
00:21:57.720 build things that super important
00:21:59.559 because it goes from hey I can build you
00:22:01.480 a line of code like co-pilot to hey you
00:22:04.520 can have your entire code
00:22:06.720 repository inside that context window so
00:22:09.559 the llm knows everything about what
00:22:12.320 you've built and what you're trying to
00:22:14.039 build and with open AI chat GPT what
00:22:18.120 what we found was that the context
00:22:19.799 window was 8,000 tokens sounds like a
00:22:22.880 lot right it's like 500 words or 500 no
00:22:27.440 no no no it's it's 6,000 Words which is
00:22:31.240 a lot so I built a whole bunch of custom
00:22:34.440 gpts the first one that I built is
00:22:36.720 probably the most useful if you like to
00:22:39.000 code and you want something super useful
00:22:42.120 and you work in the Google Cloud stack I
00:22:45.039 strongly recommend if you want a GPT to
00:22:47.760 use this one is the I love stackbot
00:22:51.360 I use this almost every day in my work
00:22:53.720 now um it allowed me to go from single
00:22:56.640 line to building complete functions um
00:22:59.960 and I thought it was super cool so I
00:23:01.360 kept going and I built um a WordPress
00:23:04.440 custom GPT I didn't know anything about
00:23:06.919 building anything in WordPress believe
00:23:08.559 it or not and this tool allowed me to
00:23:11.679 build short codes it allowed me to build
00:23:14.200 plugins it it helped me build all kinds
00:23:17.120 of stuff I even built this plugin called
00:23:20.200 the custom taxonomy grid block has
00:23:23.720 anyone ever built something with
00:23:25.240 categories and you hate the standard
00:23:27.200 layout and it's awful this thing in two
00:23:29.880 days I figured out how to build one I
00:23:32.400 built an appscript GPT which is awesome
00:23:35.520 because I love appscript if you're and
00:23:37.640 anyone who's wanting to learn like I
00:23:39.679 said earlier like appscript is the
00:23:42.080 easiest thing to learn other than python
00:23:44.760 it's super well documented it integrates
00:23:47.559 with all kinds of Google tools including
00:23:50.360 Google Sheets if you're trying to figure
00:23:52.000 out the first step to building cool
00:23:54.640 useful stuff for the agency the
00:23:57.039 superpower do would be appscript plus
00:24:00.279 Google
00:24:01.880 Sheets okay then I learned about Claud
00:24:04.640 Sonet 3.5 which is super cool super
00:24:07.840 powerful huge context window 25 times
00:24:11.120 larger than chat GPT I was like oh my
00:24:13.799 God I'm in uh I pay for the Pro Plan
00:24:16.320 it's 20 bucks a month strongly recommend
00:24:18.200 you do it um I got super excited about
00:24:21.200 it because it has this feature called
00:24:23.120 artifacts and projects which I heard as
00:24:26.559 custom you know doing the same kind of
00:24:28.679 thing as a custom
00:24:30.279 GPT
00:24:31.880 um I don't know I'm not super into it I
00:24:35.399 mean this was my take on it the way it
00:24:37.440 works is you have to manually upload
00:24:39.240 your files into into the tool and I just
00:24:42.640 felt like that whole process was super
00:24:45.720 annoying super slow and I just felt like
00:24:48.360 it was a total pain in the
00:24:50.039 ass and the reason why I didn't really
00:24:52.799 dig it is it stopped me from doing the
00:24:54.960 work it stopped me from doing iterations
00:24:57.399 and speed of iteration is really really
00:25:00.600 really the key for me anyway um I've
00:25:03.679 learned so much from everybody else here
00:25:05.679 and they all work differently but this
00:25:07.240 was as I was learning to work with the
00:25:08.919 tools this was one of my big takeaways
00:25:12.240 I'd heard of this tool called cursor
00:25:13.919 from a guy named Eric Woo and I jumped
00:25:16.799 in with both feet it's super easy if you
00:25:18.960 use vs code to move over to cursor you
00:25:21.760 basically just export your settings out
00:25:23.880 of vs code and import them into cursor
00:25:26.840 it takes 2 minutes what's cool about it
00:25:29.159 is it's basically vs code but it has AI
00:25:33.039 built right into the tool there's a free
00:25:35.760 plan and a Pro Plan free limits how many
00:25:38.799 different AI queries you can do per day
00:25:41.159 the Pro Plan is 20 bucks a month totally
00:25:44.279 sign me up all day long for that I think
00:25:46.279 it's just the coolest thing because it's
00:25:49.640 using Claud Sonet as its built-in model
00:25:52.399 it's got this huge context window so it
00:25:54.880 knows a ton about your code I'm going to
00:25:57.799 share some takeaways from doing this
00:25:59.760 whole build you're like Hey where's the
00:26:01.640 tool where's the tool we'll get to that
00:26:03.399 at the end but I just wanted to share
00:26:05.279 some of the lessons that I've learned um
00:26:08.480 and I again like when I watched Christen
00:26:10.880 talk like I was feeling impostor
00:26:13.600 syndrome in a huge way but I think these
00:26:15.960 are good best practices to get started I
00:26:19.399 think with when you're working with AI
00:26:21.640 and you're working with llms you're
00:26:23.200 trying to code and build stuff do not
00:26:26.600 say hey I want to build this thing thing
00:26:28.520 and do
00:26:29.760 this describe what you're trying to do
00:26:33.080 in the broadest terms possible describe
00:26:35.440 what your end goals are and then get the
00:26:37.840 llm to reframe back to you what you're
00:26:40.840 trying to accomplish what you're going
00:26:42.720 to find is that when it summarizes that
00:26:45.320 goal it's either going to know it's
00:26:46.960 going to say something that aligns with
00:26:48.799 how you think or it's going to be wrong
00:26:51.080 and if it's wrong you're going to iter
00:26:54.880 iteratively communicate with it back and
00:26:57.200 forth until you get the goal right and
00:27:00.279 then what you're going to find is that
00:27:01.960 it's the time to then ask it to produce
00:27:04.559 an
00:27:05.399 architecture of the thing that you're
00:27:07.399 trying to build and again it iteratively
00:27:10.120 talk with it to get make sure that you
00:27:12.159 have that all done and then what you're
00:27:14.600 going to do is ask the model to build
00:27:16.760 what's called pseudo code which to me is
00:27:19.279 just like it talking about the code and
00:27:22.720 describing it to you and if you know
00:27:24.760 what you're looking at and
00:27:26.880 you and you then sort of look at the
00:27:30.200 code you'll know if they're on the right
00:27:32.720 track or not I have not done all of the
00:27:36.520 cycles of frustration yet we haven't
00:27:39.120 gotten there um we're still trying to
00:27:41.640 get it to get the context right and
00:27:44.200 understand what it's trying to produce
00:27:46.559 if you get the pseudo code right you
00:27:48.399 then ask it to actually
00:27:50.679 code and then you've basically gotten
00:27:54.440 about 70% of the way there and the last
00:27:57.240 30% 20% 10% is the most frustrating part
00:28:01.399 of the
00:28:02.360 experience when I was building the tool
00:28:04.880 that you guys are going to get I was
00:28:06.480 trying to get it to create a data
00:28:09.039 pipeline using only
00:28:11.159 SQL and the reason I was trying to do
00:28:13.760 that was that I had a pretty complex
00:28:15.399 architecture beforehand I had Cloud
00:28:17.640 functions and task cues and all kinds of
00:28:21.360 infrastructure to support well Google
00:28:23.840 was already pushing all the data for me
00:28:26.039 up into the cloud and I was like why
00:28:28.559 can't I just do this with SQL what I
00:28:30.720 found was that that last 20 to 30% was
00:28:33.200 brutal it was like 20 hours of going
00:28:36.240 back and forth and back and forth okay
00:28:39.159 other Lessons Learned doing the build
00:28:41.559 with the bulk export the epoch version
00:28:45.000 field uh table the epoch version field
00:28:48.200 in the export log is really really
00:28:51.320 really interesting I'd never really
00:28:53.320 thought about this before but the epoch
00:28:55.640 version basically tells you what what
00:28:58.559 version of the data is up in the table
00:29:01.880 so let's say Google puts data up in the
00:29:04.000 table on day one and then they're like
00:29:06.919 oh we have data quality issues and
00:29:09.480 they have to fix it and put it back up
00:29:11.600 as Epoch version number one that's
00:29:14.480 really important that told me oh my God
00:29:17.600 I need that that my data is not
00:29:20.640 immutable when you hear about an API you
00:29:23.200 might hear it described as mutable which
00:29:25.279 means the data changes that's like
00:29:27.519 Facebook data or ads conversion data
00:29:30.880 this told me that I had to pay attention
00:29:32.720 to that which I thought was really
00:29:35.039 interesting um bulk export data costs
00:29:38.840 let's get into this because this is
00:29:40.559 super super
00:29:42.840 interesting when you go to the tools web
00:29:45.960 page there's going to be a calculator at
00:29:47.919 the bottom of the page that's going to
00:29:49.320 help you think through this basically
00:29:51.399 what you're going to do is look at the
00:29:52.799 data that's in your table and then
00:29:55.200 divide it by the number of partitions
00:29:57.919 that that basically tells you how many
00:29:59.919 megabytes or gigabytes of data are going
00:30:02.720 up into big query every single day and
00:30:05.960 that's going to help you calculate how
00:30:08.000 much the budget is and yeah I did use AI
00:30:10.840 to build that tool on the web page too
00:30:13.200 which was pretty cool um here's a major
00:30:16.480 downside of the bulk export there is no
00:30:19.159 back fill it's just like uh GA data also
00:30:23.200 what you're going to find is that Dave
00:30:25.240 was
00:30:26.559 wrong Dave was WR it's not something
00:30:30.039 that I perceive anyway that in 4 months
00:30:32.200 is going to be something that all of us
00:30:34.279 can just go build stuff like I I build
00:30:37.240 things for a living that's my job I'm
00:30:39.679 like the director of innovation for
00:30:41.279 Sterling sky and I found that it was
00:30:44.240 hard I found that it was really
00:30:45.840 frustrating and I found that almost that
00:30:48.600 co-pilot way of working was an easier
00:30:52.159 way
00:30:53.760 intellectually um to work I could get
00:30:56.240 stuff done probably fast
00:30:58.600 and understanding the wide world of
00:31:00.880 possibilities that's I think the sweet
00:31:03.120 spot for AI but like getting it done
00:31:06.120 efficiently it was just such a
00:31:08.000 frustrating build um and when I talk
00:31:11.279 about early adopters really it's like a
00:31:13.960 tolerance for pain and I feel like you
00:31:16.320 had to have just an enormous tolerance
00:31:19.039 for pain to kind of work with it that
00:31:21.120 was that was my piece and you and you
00:31:23.000 really have to be um ready to deal with
00:31:27.559 risk
00:31:29.799 okay also um just to give you all kinds
00:31:33.799 of other insights like models create all
00:31:35.880 kinds of trash outputs like that was
00:31:38.000 that was a key piece I wanted to build
00:31:39.880 my deck with AI too after I'd already
00:31:41.519 built the tool I was like hey let's
00:31:42.919 let's just build all my
00:31:44.880 slides I think this would be super fun
00:31:47.399 if you want to see how a AI goes wrong
00:31:49.559 by the way if you want to see how to
00:31:50.559 build slides with it but this this is
00:31:53.360 the input like hey I want to build a
00:31:55.240 16x9 slide because that's what Google
00:31:57.919 slides are right and I want it to look
00:32:01.279 um I want it to have like a cool
00:32:03.360 geometric pattern blah blah blah this is
00:32:06.679 what it came out
00:32:11.559 with I just wanted a freaking slide that
00:32:14.600 said building software is hard
00:32:17.799 right 10 iterations
00:32:24.440 later and then it and then it throws an
00:32:26.799 error at me it's it's like you're
00:32:28.519 generating images too quickly to ensure
00:32:31.000 the best you know the best experience
00:32:33.080 for everyone we have to rate limit you
00:32:34.600 it's like ah like this doesn't
00:32:37.559 work um we're going back and forth and
00:32:40.320 back and forth after more things it's
00:32:42.399 like
00:32:43.240 understood here here's the goal it told
00:32:46.320 me what I wanted it's like the goal is
00:32:48.919 to ensure a clean edgo Edge geometric
00:32:51.399 background with only text centered on
00:32:53.240 the slide and no additional objects or
00:32:55.159 distractions
00:32:59.240 it just could not get it and then it
00:33:02.399 throws this at this stage I recommend
00:33:04.480 using a graphic design tool I can but
00:33:07.080 fig M
00:33:09.639 PowerPoint super this was as close as I
00:33:13.000 could
00:33:13.960 get and this was an hour in and I kept
00:33:18.200 saying please make it lighter please
00:33:20.080 make it lighter please make it lighter
00:33:21.960 and every step along the way it would
00:33:23.799 get darker and darker and darker it was
00:33:26.399 like h so yeah models lie you know I
00:33:31.360 would say things like hey I want you to
00:33:34.399 using cursor I would say hey I want you
00:33:36.880 to put the code in my repository file
00:33:39.799 tree and it would say I said hey can you
00:33:42.480 put it there and it's like certainly
00:33:43.919 I'll create a new file called blah blah
00:33:45.720 blah and I'll put it in this directory
00:33:47.600 and here's the content of the file and
00:33:50.480 I'm like where's the code I kept
00:33:52.360 refreshing my repo and it and there was
00:33:54.440 no code there was no file and I'm like
00:33:56.960 do I not have the write permissions like
00:33:58.919 only vs code has permissions on my files
00:34:02.000 15 minutes later um it responds with as
00:34:05.200 an AI language model I don't have direct
00:34:07.919 access to your code codebase or file
00:34:10.440 system I was like well then why' you
00:34:12.520 tell me that you built the
00:34:14.639 file so that's a major downside of
00:34:17.079 building with cursor by the way if you
00:34:19.639 want to have the tool output code
00:34:22.918 directly for you and make code edits for
00:34:25.918 you cursor is not quite quite the way to
00:34:28.280 go and we'll get to another tool but
00:34:30.320 anyway this was my
00:34:31.918 feeling um AER a i d r Eric Woo again
00:34:36.800 came to the rescue told me all about AER
00:34:39.320 it's a python tool it uses whatever llm
00:34:43.359 you want to use it'll create all your
00:34:46.639 code for you it'll create all the files
00:34:49.560 for you it'll edit files it'll delete
00:34:51.960 files anytime you ask it to do anything
00:34:54.839 it'll make a git commit for you on your
00:34:58.119 behalf if you don't like it you can roll
00:35:00.800 the code back with just a simple slash
00:35:03.040 command you just slash undo and it undos
00:35:06.599 the commit for you and you can try and
00:35:09.119 try again which is really really good uh
00:35:12.880 I saw this trolling around Reddit a
00:35:15.599 little bit after I'd already built my
00:35:17.320 deck which is great um there's five
00:35:20.000 levels of different um this is a great
00:35:23.160 slide for you to do exploration too to
00:35:25.119 figure out more tools because you
00:35:26.480 probably haven't heard of
00:35:28.440 like a lot of folks hadn't heard of Aer
00:35:30.599 and so they probably hadn't heard of any
00:35:32.079 of the competitors either right but
00:35:34.599 basically you're going to go from
00:35:35.960 co-pilot cursor and then you're going to
00:35:38.320 use AER and then there's a whole bunch
00:35:40.280 of Aer um tools that are and stuff
00:35:45.119 that's like way way more um enterpris so
00:35:50.480 they they tend to lose a lot of context
00:35:53.480 and they lose broken code uh Mike asked
00:35:56.640 me about hey you can just fix the error
00:35:59.359 right I could not get my head wrapped
00:36:02.400 around why it was throwing natural
00:36:04.520 language into code I just couldn't
00:36:06.599 figure that out and it um it happens all
00:36:09.319 the time and that one piece is why I'm
00:36:12.160 not afraid of it taking all of our jobs
00:36:16.200 because if it can't produce valid code
00:36:21.000 and it after 12 iterations like people
00:36:25.319 are not going to adopt the technology
00:36:27.040 that's broken like it's just not quite
00:36:29.640 good enough okay so the tool that I
00:36:32.680 built it's going to have a pretty cool
00:36:34.839 sign up page you're not signing up
00:36:37.000 you're not giving me information but
00:36:38.440 it'll walk you through the whole setup
00:36:40.240 page AI built the whole thing which is
00:36:43.079 pretty rad it built the the neat pricing
00:36:45.720 table down below this is the link if you
00:36:49.079 do want to for some reason grab that QR
00:36:51.680 code right now you can set up your own
00:36:54.319 data pipeline which is Super Rad it'll
00:36:57.319 take about 20 to 30
00:36:59.160 minutes this is me I've Loved hanging
00:37:02.079 out with you guys today I hope I brought
00:37:04.200 enough energy post lunch for everybody
00:37:06.640 thanks a lot
00:37:10.000 y'all thank you
