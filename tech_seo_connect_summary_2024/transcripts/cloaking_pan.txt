# When is cloaking a good idea? - Victor Pan
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/JW2hJB5TzEk

00:00:10.320 hello one all
00:00:12.200 right uh yeah that was the intro when is
00:00:15.000 cloaking a good idea well Google's not
00:00:17.000 here anymore so uh we can actually get
00:00:19.439 going with this and uh this stays here
00:00:22.279 right it's not live streamed wait it is
00:00:24.240 it's okay because this might have
00:00:27.359 happened 5 years ago uh
00:00:38.239 there we go all right so uh yeah
00:00:41.239 cloaking it can actually improve your
00:00:43.440 SEO uh and just like any other medical
00:00:46.760 ad in the United States or New Zealand
00:00:49.239 as the other country that actually
00:00:51.000 allows this I have to caveat all this
00:00:54.480 side effects that you might have when
00:00:56.160 you cloak especially if you're caught by
00:00:57.920 Google doing any of these things does is
00:01:00.160 not officially sanctioned by Google in
00:01:02.000 any ways but just something that might
00:01:04.519 have happened around 5 years ago for
00:01:07.159 some B2B SAS company that I might have
00:01:10.320 been working at cool all right so uh
00:01:14.560 yeah we already had an intro we can skip
00:01:16.320 that uh that's the mass thing that's
00:01:19.119 actually a Kendo uh Menan I do Kendo
00:01:23.000 which is Japanese SW fighting that's
00:01:24.720 actually how I met my wife but that's
00:01:26.200 another story
00:01:27.479 altogether uh yeah that's the rough
00:01:29.560 agenda that I'm not really following but
00:01:32.520 if you want to get a sense of that
00:01:34.240 that's what's I'm going to talk
00:01:36.320 about and it all started a long long
00:01:39.479 time ago about fiveish years ago there's
00:01:42.600 this like crazy slack Channel that's
00:01:46.240 really secretive only for certain people
00:01:49.040 inevitably some guy or gal in support
00:01:52.600 will find it and we have to boot them
00:01:54.159 out but really what we were having an
00:01:56.119 issue there was
00:01:57.520 gdpr and everyone one is impacted by
00:02:01.159 gdpr everyone has to put cookie consent
00:02:03.880 on their websites and back then we're
00:02:06.280 like oh that should be no issue right
00:02:09.080 like we really
00:02:11.560 measure uh impact by uh whether or not
00:02:16.040 someone has signed up for HubSpot or if
00:02:19.560 they asked for some sort of action and
00:02:22.239 what we learned was that was not consent
00:02:26.040 so if you signed up and became like a
00:02:29.360 free customer cust or a free user but
00:02:31.360 you actually denied cooking
00:02:34.080 consent that would break our
00:02:37.440 attribution and guess what I don't think
00:02:41.080 this is actually going to get any better
00:02:43.000 and that's why I felt like this was a
00:02:45.120 this would be a great talk to talk about
00:02:47.200 right so again if you think about gaing
00:02:50.080 people from uh accessing content or
00:02:53.440 doing anything like cor does like hey
00:02:55.840 you want to read more all that and
00:02:57.840 getting it like you you don't get any of
00:03:00.760 that data unless you accept that cookie
00:03:03.720 it's
00:03:05.159 direct so uh yeah gdpr impacts everyone
00:03:10.200 here because you don't know where a EU
00:03:14.040 citizen may be searching for so
00:03:16.440 originally we were like ah we'll just go
00:03:18.400 to search console we'll see like what
00:03:20.080 the traffic is in all these countries
00:03:22.040 and then we'll get a rough estimate of
00:03:23.519 the impact just don't do it there's no
00:03:26.040 point like everyone's impacted right
00:03:28.959 like you just don't know where these uh
00:03:31.680 lawsuits and number of fines might come
00:03:33.760 from and originally the thought back
00:03:35.560 then was like well are they really going
00:03:37.159 to enforce it how are they going to
00:03:38.599 enforce it well it's going up and
00:03:41.480 obligatory uh I'm not a lawyer but you
00:03:44.760 know so uh what did we discover when we
00:03:48.840 started enabling cookie tracking and
00:03:51.280 making sure that we actually don't track
00:03:53.799 the people that denied
00:03:55.239 consent one of these
00:03:57.680 countries rejected consent and stop
00:04:00.640 showing
00:04:01.879 analytics is it
00:04:03.959 Germany France Japan United
00:04:07.599 States and the answer is
00:04:10.840 Germany over half the
00:04:13.079 visitors just want nothing to do with
00:04:15.879 cooking scent and so the German team was
00:04:18.639 really scared because that's how we
00:04:20.720 figure out everything in our business
00:04:22.800 via attribution and so that conversion
00:04:25.560 Source was about to be not provided
00:04:27.840 right for that whole team and if you've
00:04:29.600 been been in SEO long enough you know
00:04:31.680 that phase is really scary but of course
00:04:35.240 AI can solve all of Humanity's problems
00:04:38.800 right conversion modeling from
00:04:43.800 ga4 so what do they do AI goes in sees
00:04:49.520 direct and says oh some of that direct
00:04:51.680 goes to these other
00:04:53.880 buckets okay do you believe
00:04:57.360 that what if their AI model improves
00:05:00.720 does that data
00:05:02.240 backtrack do you see the problem here
00:05:04.840 you don't control that right and so that
00:05:07.880 was our main concern you need to be able
00:05:10.280 to know you know what's generating money
00:05:13.240 for your business and Heck if they roll
00:05:16.199 back something or do something like we
00:05:18.919 don't control that so this is what
00:05:21.560 actually
00:05:22.800 happened we added a last touch
00:05:25.720 attribution script in JavaScript that
00:05:28.759 would append in internal parameters in
00:05:31.680 our links so you know that golden advice
00:05:34.400 in SEO saying don't ever hardcode UTM
00:05:37.680 parameters in your internal
00:05:40.039 links well oops uh we created a new
00:05:43.720 parameter and we're hardcoding it in Via
00:05:46.560 JavaScript what could go wrong well I'm
00:05:50.240 going to highlight two
00:05:52.600 things uh number one why do we have to
00:05:55.440 do this well because at where I work
00:05:58.800 everything goes down to the dollar money
00:06:01.479 um value everyone knows uh why the work
00:06:05.759 we do is valuable and so it all starts
00:06:08.639 with understanding the searches people
00:06:11.599 make how those searches are tied to the
00:06:14.120 products we sell how many of those PE of
00:06:17.199 those Searchers Is it feasible for us to
00:06:18.840 actually Rank and get traffic
00:06:20.919 from how in an organic channel do they
00:06:24.960 convert and then in that
00:06:27.440 conversion uh type whether it's a lead
00:06:30.280 they uh an offer they download a demo
00:06:33.639 they request for a sales rep or a free
00:06:35.440 account they
00:06:36.400 create you know of those people then
00:06:39.400 towards the end how much money will they
00:06:41.919 actually pay to us
00:06:45.120 right and so you can throw some
00:06:47.280 hypothetical numbers here maybe you did
00:06:50.240 a bunch of keyword research you got to a
00:06:53.160 uh 100 million and then you're like oh I
00:06:55.680 can only capture 1% of that and uh our
00:06:58.199 conversion rate suck so it's % and maybe
00:07:02.199 uh a person booking a demo actually
00:07:04.160 becoming a paid customer is
00:07:05.960 10% uh and if we sell something that
00:07:08.400 expensive that's maybe like $1,000 a
00:07:10.759 month all of a sudden you're generating
00:07:13.800 $1 million a month and wow if you are
00:07:18.080 someone thinking about how do I get that
00:07:20.080 promotion how do I create a team for
00:07:22.160 more
00:07:23.120 headcount really understanding your
00:07:25.720 business and mapping this golden PA of
00:07:29.840 triangle however we want to invert it
00:07:31.400 doesn't matter is really important and
00:07:35.039 again why are we highlighing these two
00:07:37.039 numbers in yellow those are the parts
00:07:39.800 that I said we cared about that last
00:07:41.720 touch attribution that we were not
00:07:43.879 seeding control over to Google that we
00:07:46.599 went to very far deps to control and do
00:07:50.000 last touch
00:07:53.319 attribution
00:07:55.440 right all right so what could go wrong
00:07:58.199 more craw better ranking right we just
00:08:00.319 had that
00:08:01.479 question
00:08:03.159 uh so we got about 212 million requests
00:08:08.080 maybe maybe that happened maybe this was
00:08:10.960 only one cctld
00:08:14.159 maybe what could go
00:08:16.479 wrong well uh let's just say product was
00:08:21.039 like what the is SEO doing uh and
00:08:23.520 then SEO was just like we weren't
00:08:25.720 actually in this meeting at all this was
00:08:27.639 decided by another team and so
00:08:31.279 uh fortunately maybe back then we might
00:08:34.839 have shared some infrastructure with our
00:08:36.640 customers and that's why it's like a
00:08:38.200 critical situation that we remedy this
00:08:40.958 and so uh other things started cropping
00:08:44.640 that that was
00:08:46.120 very stupid um
00:08:48.920 interesting uh so these parameters were
00:08:52.600 showing up on other people's websites
00:08:55.200 not even related to us so up here I'll
00:08:58.680 just read it out Department of Labor
00:09:00.760 Google Salesforce Microsoft like I I
00:09:03.800 don't I have no idea how these started
00:09:05.839 showing up in other people's sites as
00:09:08.279 duplicate content that is indexed on the
00:09:10.360 web but that
00:09:13.880 happened so
00:09:15.959 shortterm
00:09:17.680 throwback uh this might have happened a
00:09:20.000 long time ago right so we had the
00:09:22.200 parameter handling tool that is you know
00:09:24.640 rest in peace
00:09:26.399 2022 uh and we had about 300ish that we
00:09:29.640 said why might as well tackle that while
00:09:31.240 we're here instead of the seven that I
00:09:32.839 just listed and just to appease the
00:09:35.839 product team we're like hey let's crawl
00:09:38.040 limits Google Bots and uh make sure our
00:09:41.320 customers are taken care of because
00:09:42.720 that's always our prime
00:09:44.200 directive uh yeah good riddance uh crawl
00:09:49.480 parameter tool didn't use it's like
00:09:52.040 useless
00:09:53.320 basically it's not very effective uh
00:09:56.000 again we looked at our log files and
00:09:57.480 we're just like hey I thought I told
00:09:59.680 Google just to ignore it CU it doesn't
00:10:02.320 really change the content at
00:10:04.959 all so what was the big fix it was
00:10:08.079 actually just to block googlebot from
00:10:10.600 executing the JavaScript that was
00:10:12.079 appending
00:10:14.600 parameters and you know as a good SEO
00:10:17.959 will do is when you have a crisis don't
00:10:19.720 waste it you have resources to
00:10:21.920 investigate other things that are weird
00:10:24.040 and shouldn't happen you might as well
00:10:26.200 go ahead and Tackle those too so uh yeah
00:10:28.959 you're like what's IP lookup well uh
00:10:32.480 that's something that we do in our CMS
00:10:34.560 where we based off of your IP address
00:10:37.880 might personalize uh the content on your
00:10:40.200 page we call that smart content does
00:10:42.480 googlebot care about that should he even
00:10:44.440 try to load that it doesn't need to oh
00:10:46.120 okay let's just block it uh yeah so we
00:10:50.880 started actually from all those crawls
00:10:53.720 to get up to 200 to one duplicates and
00:10:57.519 then over time that go close to 20 to1
00:11:01.360 and you know there's it's it was a big
00:11:03.600 win back then of things we were worried
00:11:05.519 about uh but again there's a lot of room
00:11:08.880 for improvement because once you start
00:11:11.360 going down this Rabbit Hole of like wait
00:11:13.839 I can block googlebot and basically be
00:11:16.440 cloaking and when a person sees you know
00:11:19.720 all that long parameter to that and then
00:11:21.920 Google just sees one without a parameter
00:11:24.040 and we didn't get a manual penalty from
00:11:28.079 this right right like
00:11:30.760 hm why stop here so if you're doing
00:11:34.200 Dynamic rendering right you're like okay
00:11:39.079 if users don't need schema open graft
00:11:42.600 data and other meta metadata for Bots
00:11:45.360 why are we loading it for them like you
00:11:47.959 could improve your web core vital there
00:11:49.600 right or maybe like you know Bots don't
00:11:51.920 execute non- rening scripts so if you
00:11:54.160 have ad tracking uh heat Maps tag
00:11:57.000 manager uh I'll leave a testing out of
00:11:59.560 this for now cuz that's still
00:12:00.760 technically cloaking they have a lot of
00:12:02.480 really strict guidelines there but I'm
00:12:04.600 personally in the belief that they might
00:12:06.200 as well make it simpler and just say hey
00:12:07.880 we can just totally block Google bot
00:12:09.959 from uh any AV testing platforms uh but
00:12:14.120 uh last but not least another thing you
00:12:16.760 can think about with this whole concept
00:12:18.920 is if you're doing stuff on the edge if
00:12:22.320 you have parameterizations that you
00:12:24.920 know that correctly
00:12:27.600 canonicalize to a parameterless
00:12:31.000 URL why are we wasting all this time for
00:12:34.240 Google to visit the URL render the whole
00:12:36.920 thing and go like hm yeah we'll uh
00:12:40.839 canonicalize to the parameter lless one
00:12:43.320 why don't we just instead of a strong
00:12:45.839 hint strong arm Google and saying that's
00:12:48.440 a
00:12:50.320 301 saves everyone some time right and
00:12:53.639 that last one I haven't done yet caveat
00:12:56.360 caveat caveat but if you've already done
00:12:58.480 that I'd love to from
00:13:00.279 you so uh yeah this is the most boring
00:13:03.079 slide that I have right uh
00:13:06.760 so it's a good idea to cloak when what
00:13:10.120 you're serving users is essentially the
00:13:11.680 same as uh what search Eng get in spirit
00:13:16.800 right they kind of give you a pass for
00:13:17.959 that and then you should only do this
00:13:20.560 when you can actually get credit from
00:13:22.320 this right like whether it's cost
00:13:24.880 savings with the producting like most
00:13:27.079 people don't really get assigned to that
00:13:29.560 like J was just saying like oh the bites
00:13:31.600 it's like it's a large number it doesn't
00:13:33.399 matter I was like well if you can make
00:13:34.760 it matter and you know claim credit for
00:13:37.839 it then it's a good thing for your
00:13:40.519 career right um so maybe reducing server
00:13:44.399 costs or maybe there's Engineers you
00:13:45.680 want to work with that are gold on that
00:13:47.000 and you want to build that
00:13:48.399 relationship those are things to look
00:13:50.240 into and if your workplace cares about
00:13:54.320 sustainability less wasted bites on the
00:13:57.360 wire just make the world a better place
00:14:00.440 right so last but not least a little bit
00:14:03.440 more controversial you know when it's
00:14:05.120 personalization it's not really cloaking
00:14:07.720 and Google's good with that right so
00:14:10.079 that's another angle to look at it with
00:14:11.920 you know if you have cookies or if you
00:14:13.279 don't for personalization and some cases
00:14:16.519 location and again tons of caveats
00:14:20.560 here so uh should you even care about my
00:14:24.959 presentation well if this is your crawl
00:14:27.320 stats report and you see like a trillion
00:14:31.000 there or I think that's a trillion yeah
00:14:33.720 okay I don't know what comes after T is
00:14:35.279 it a q an s or G but uh if that is what
00:14:38.480 your crawl stats looks like then I think
00:14:41.959 you should really try to save some
00:14:47.120 trees right like just have Google bot
00:14:51.600 not
00:14:52.800 crawl uh your Google tag manager and
00:14:55.440 maybe you've already saved a th
00:14:57.639 trees just saying
00:15:00.040 right and again it's it's some pretty
00:15:03.480 rough SEO math here that I'm facing this
00:15:06.440 off of but whatever that bite
00:15:08.519 differential It Is by going to the site
00:15:11.040 of like hey they had to crawl this with
00:15:13.199 all these scripts versus without that's
00:15:16.040 kind of the difference that you can then
00:15:18.120 bring over to teams and again if your
00:15:21.199 company mission statement has you know
00:15:24.680 offsetting CO2 emissions and all that
00:15:26.800 this is a perfect site and again hat tip
00:15:28.720 here to arnout
00:15:30.120 Helman uh for uh sharing another deck
00:15:32.880 he's worked on and again he deeply cares
00:15:35.519 about performance and the impact on
00:15:39.639 sustainability uh another one here on
00:15:42.319 the note of
00:15:44.079 personalization uh why resize images
00:15:47.680 like in your personal devices and then
00:15:50.319 have that load really slowly when you
00:15:52.720 could just do that on the edge right and
00:15:56.079 Jon o here has his own gith head Rebo of
00:15:59.279 this where you can really if you're on
00:16:02.279 both
00:16:03.360 WordPress and have Cloud flare uh paid
00:16:06.560 account that you can serve the exact
00:16:10.680 image
00:16:11.680 dimensions for the user versus having
00:16:14.360 the user load the images and then have
00:16:16.120 to resize it so this will help your cor
00:16:18.399 web vital it'll save the environment a
00:16:21.120 little bit and again this is
00:16:23.880 personalization it's not really cloaking
00:16:26.600 so there's a lot of smart things we can
00:16:28.600 do when we really think about like what
00:16:30.519 we serve people versus what we serve
00:16:32.800 search engines and do we really need to
00:16:35.279 serve all this junk to search
00:16:37.440 engines so yeah cloaking right now as
00:16:40.720 it's defined in search console is the
00:16:43.120 practice of presenting different content
00:16:45.000 to users and search engines with the
00:16:47.079 intent to manipulate search rankings and
00:16:48.839 mislead users so again the good
00:16:51.720 definition is we're not misleading users
00:16:54.560 and if your technology uh if site uses
00:16:56.720 Technologies and search engines have
00:16:58.160 difficulty accessing
00:16:59.360 JavaScript images they have
00:17:01.279 recommendations right on what to use uh
00:17:05.119 I doctored this slly there's some
00:17:06.520 examples in between but what I would
00:17:09.959 propose like you
00:17:12.199 know maybe you know we can say there's
00:17:15.039 cloaking it's still different content
00:17:17.119 for users and search engines but when
00:17:20.400 we're doing this to save
00:17:22.520 resources right without misleading users
00:17:25.919 it's a great idea uh we're on YouTube
00:17:28.520 right so I can't swear I can't monetize
00:17:33.080 thiswear do it yeah it's a great
00:17:35.160 idea
00:17:36.880 guys and you know I I'm I'm kind of just
00:17:40.240 being kind of subtle about this because
00:17:42.360 I don't want to wake up the next day and
00:17:43.799 I have like a manual penalty and waiting
00:17:45.799 in my inbox but uh again if your site is
00:17:49.400 using Technologies that's difficult for
00:17:51.840 search
00:17:52.640 engines like JavaScript generating
00:17:55.480 parameters or like you have tracking
00:17:57.240 pixels from ads that you Google really
00:17:59.799 shouldn't care like then you know follow
00:18:03.440 some recommendations for reducing any
00:18:05.720 kind of unnecessary data transfers by
00:18:08.640 cloaking like that should just be a good
00:18:10.760 thing for everyone hopefully right so
00:18:15.320 again uh thank
00:18:19.180 [Applause]
00:18:27.760 you and
