00:00:12.759 thank you
00:00:14.839 sir hey everyone I just really want to
00:00:18.439 say thank you all our speakers all our
00:00:21.240 sponsors all of y'all we did it we
00:00:25.480 pulled this off uh but only because
00:00:27.760 y'all made it happen too uh y'all
00:00:30.000 trusted us believed in us I'm going to
00:00:32.040 cry up here uh no really really
00:00:35.840 appreciative we're going to do this
00:00:37.200 again next year we'll tell you all about
00:00:38.680 that in a
00:00:41.039 bit so I last year did a big data study
00:00:45.440 uh literally site AIT million
00:00:47.760 websites we don't need to talk about me
00:00:51.239 lots of cool data there lots of issues
00:00:54.320 sites are a mess web the web is messy in
00:00:57.640 general you can actually see the full
00:00:59.680 data
00:01:00.440 but I'm not going to cover the full data
00:01:04.040 here there was a substudy also with h
00:01:07.200 Ling 3 some thousand what 374,000
00:01:12.560 domains all the issues there there's a
00:01:15.200 whole HF Lane study there we have a cool
00:01:17.880 like visualization tool for HF Lane
00:01:20.320 clusters it's complex but like that
00:01:21.840 makes it super easy to see like what's
00:01:23.479 screwed up in
00:01:26.720 this the thing is just because
00:01:29.960 something's a best practice doesn't mean
00:01:32.399 it's actually important so the most
00:01:34.119 common issues are the ones people aren't
00:01:36.119 actually
00:01:37.200 solving they're not actually working on
00:01:39.560 this because sometimes it costs more to
00:01:42.399 fix something than the value that that
00:01:44.880 actually
00:01:48.000 provides and prioritization of the fixes
00:01:50.840 is
00:01:52.360 hard I use like an impact effort Matrix
00:01:55.240 so I try and say like okay how big is
00:01:57.039 the scale how much impact is this going
00:01:58.640 to have how much is this going to cost
00:01:59.920 calls me when can I do this uh and try
00:02:03.320 and figure out like what am I going to
00:02:04.439 work on what am I actually going to go
00:02:06.200 fix what am I just going to let slide
00:02:08.520 and never fix potentially because it
00:02:11.440 costs too much and there's a lot of
00:02:13.640 things like that again best practices
00:02:15.920 things you should do there's a lot of
00:02:17.840 things that are flagged Even in our side
00:02:19.840 audit that I'm just like h no never
00:02:23.000 going to never going to touch
00:02:25.879 that so you may think like why do SEO
00:02:28.920 tools do this why do they flag things
00:02:30.519 well there could be other issues that
00:02:32.040 you want to dig into a lot of people a
00:02:34.480 lot of the feedback has been like well
00:02:36.800 we use it for sales like oh big red
00:02:38.760 number lots of issues sell that to a
00:02:43.640 client there's a lot of different
00:02:45.480 variables that impact prioritization for
00:02:48.080 different issues just going to give a
00:02:49.480 few examples of those like broken pages
00:02:52.360 so the whole thing like does a tree if a
00:02:54.080 tree falls in the woods does anyone hear
00:02:56.319 the sound so if no one actually like
00:02:58.440 goes to that page if it's not being hit
00:03:00.879 there's no links to the page it's broken
00:03:03.360 do I care
00:03:05.840 no so people some people are like I have
00:03:08.319 to fix those 37,000 broken Pages I'm
00:03:11.720 like n it's okay no one ever sees it not
00:03:14.200 even bad for ux at that point no one
00:03:15.680 sees it right so it's not just SEO like
00:03:18.480 I can argue that from a
00:03:20.360 ux and you can set all kinds of like
00:03:22.560 business Logic for this stuff so like
00:03:24.200 how many hits in the last 30 days do I
00:03:26.360 want to redirect it or how many links
00:03:28.560 blah blah blah redirect it I think this
00:03:31.599 got shared out earlier by someone else
00:03:33.519 uh Sam I think um full text matching
00:03:37.439 redirect
00:03:43.400 script it's also a question of do you
00:03:46.040 even bother like sometimes the redirects
00:03:48.080 were there but then they got lost or
00:03:49.640 whatever uh there's a big study on this
00:03:52.079 that I did I deleted a bunch of
00:03:53.760 redirects over a year Google said it
00:03:55.560 wouldn't do anything it didn't do
00:03:57.000 anything so exactly uh I personally am
00:04:01.239 usually a fan of keeping redirects
00:04:02.720 forever but like if you want to set
00:04:04.599 business logic and say like after a year
00:04:06.239 or two just delete the redirects clean
00:04:08.079 up your system seems to actually be okay
00:04:11.439 I was very skeptical about that by the
00:04:13.280 way it's like I'm going to screw some
00:04:16.320 stuff
00:04:19.839 up multiple H1 tags I still see this
00:04:23.600 it's flagged and this is allow the only
00:04:26.199 question really is are they
00:04:28.320 relevant if you have multiple and
00:04:30.240 they're all relevant who cares good
00:04:32.400 you're you're all good I don't know why
00:04:35.000 a lot of seos focus on this broken
00:04:37.800 images again tree falls in the woods if
00:04:40.440 no one sees it no one goes to that page
00:04:42.360 do I care if an image is broken on the
00:04:43.919 page no one sees it
00:04:47.639 no then there are things that seos tend
00:04:49.919 to prioritize too high uh one is
00:04:52.320 duplicate content usually page is going
00:04:54.039 to be indexed one way or another you're
00:04:55.680 like oh why is like this index with a
00:04:58.440 parameter does it anything not
00:05:02.479 really a lot of the web is duplicate
00:05:05.080 content 60% according to
00:05:08.080 google they're pretty good at figuring
00:05:10.240 this
00:05:11.080 out like they have this whole
00:05:12.759 canonicalization system like 20 or so
00:05:15.080 different signals and they figure out
00:05:17.080 which version of the page to index yeah
00:05:18.479 they get it wrong sometimes but again
00:05:19.840 it's indexed one way or another all the
00:05:21.800 signals usually consolidate I don't care
00:05:24.800 it's
00:05:27.400 fine orphan pages
00:05:30.440 I love when people like focus on this
00:05:32.080 because I'm like you didn't care enough
00:05:33.880 to actually link to it but you think the
00:05:35.800 page is
00:05:37.919 important H
00:05:42.919 fascinating and then whatever is new
00:05:45.000 there's always popular you know for a
00:05:47.520 while it was like mobile friendliness
00:05:49.080 Corb
00:05:51.720 vitals uh there was the whole like
00:05:53.479 mobile gon thing they're like oh it's
00:05:55.080 going to be the end of the world if your
00:05:56.160 site isn't mobile friendly and thud
00:05:58.800 nothing nothing
00:06:02.199 happened there are some things you
00:06:03.919 should worry about though again the the
00:06:05.759 web is messy
00:06:08.520 um it's how what do you actually want to
00:06:13.680 fix for me uh oh sorry this is actually
00:06:17.960 things you should not worry about sorry
00:06:19.400 getting ahead of myself getting ahead of
00:06:22.199 myself one thing redirect chains you
00:06:25.479 know uh I don't even look at these until
00:06:27.880 they get like greater than five some
00:06:29.599 people are like well it slows down blah
00:06:31.639 blah blah someone clicks that it's
00:06:33.479 probably like
00:06:34.400 0.03 seconds to follow that chain it's
00:06:38.759 fine they'll follow up to 10 hops
00:06:41.160 usually so until it gets over five I
00:06:43.160 don't even look I don't bother why do
00:06:46.080 that work like no basically no impact
00:06:48.960 whatsoever everything is
00:06:52.560 Consolidated double slashes and URLs all
00:06:55.479 this ignored there's I could give a
00:06:57.599 thousand examples for all of these but I
00:06:59.199 only have 30 minutes by the
00:07:02.160 way some HF length things use an
00:07:05.360 underscore instead of a dash guess what
00:07:07.319 no one cares Google's fine with it or
00:07:10.840 even I've seen this in a lot of H refl
00:07:13.800 articles actually mention like I anduk
00:07:15.560 they're like that's for Ukraine no that
00:07:17.680 would be UA
00:07:19.160 actually uh UK is a reserved code and so
00:07:23.599 back when Google had a report on this if
00:07:25.759 you someone used Enuk there was no error
00:07:28.479 in the report in gsse ever it always
00:07:32.680 swapped properly never was an issue
00:07:35.759 never seen it be an issue my entire
00:07:38.960 career but some people are like you need
00:07:40.919 to fix that well it's it's working it's
00:07:44.000 good to probably continue to work until
00:07:45.879 it actually breaks something I don't
00:07:49.840 care what you actually should do is
00:07:52.400 focus on Roi if a site actually was like
00:07:56.520 I'm going to fix everything I'm going to
00:07:58.240 be like you're going to waste so much
00:08:01.000 money you should not do that it's
00:08:04.440 ridiculous I again best practice versus
00:08:06.560 like practical Google's like yeah you
00:08:08.840 should fix all your blah blah blah no
00:08:11.080 like no there's no business case for it
00:08:13.240 to be
00:08:19.240 made I'm a big fan of just taking the
00:08:22.680 easy wins go after the things that
00:08:25.000 matter the most the things that are
00:08:26.319 going to have the most
00:08:27.639 impact so one thing content security
00:08:30.560 policy this isn't going to have a huge
00:08:33.039 impact any impact really but if you want
00:08:36.479 to fix it it's very simple you can do
00:08:39.599 upgrade insecure requests it's going to
00:08:41.599 fix every mixed content issue on your
00:08:43.559 entire
00:08:44.680 website and that's all you got to do
00:08:46.760 takes two
00:08:48.399 minutes I've literally seen teams with
00:08:51.120 like we have like 2,000 links we need to
00:08:53.480 go change and I'm like no what are you
00:08:56.720 doing
00:09:01.680 all attributes not again not the biggest
00:09:05.360 like SEO issue uh literally just counts
00:09:08.519 for um well okay so it helps in image
00:09:11.240 search let me get that out of the way uh
00:09:14.480 but for like ranking of the page itself
00:09:16.560 literally whatever you put there counts
00:09:18.240 as like content on the page that's
00:09:20.959 it where it is a problem it's like
00:09:24.079 accessibility or like legal
00:09:27.279 issues uh so people can be sued
00:09:30.279 uh in the US because yeah you didn't
00:09:32.519 make
00:09:33.680 your I got to stay away from that
00:09:36.240 apparently uh because uh you actually
00:09:39.079 need your website to be accessible if
00:09:40.800 not yeah lawsuits millions of dollars it
00:09:43.240 happens all the
00:09:45.360 time how about
00:09:47.880 redir so my ultimate everything for
00:09:51.320 redir is like I don't want to touch it
00:09:53.200 again I wrote that redirect matching
00:09:54.640 script but like that's just the start
00:09:57.240 that does the matching for the pages you
00:09:59.760 could store all your old content all
00:10:02.399 your new content have the matches just
00:10:04.839 output right
00:10:06.200 there um like here's the matches like
00:10:10.320 top three top five top one however you
00:10:12.640 want to do it and say like do you
00:10:15.640 actually want to do
00:10:17.320 this so you could have it with a click
00:10:19.800 and say like or you literally can
00:10:21.720 automate and say like just do the
00:10:23.120 redirect the next closest thing
00:10:24.800 automatically for me I never have to
00:10:27.000 look at a redirect or you can say like
00:10:29.800 Okay click a button to prove this or
00:10:31.240 like I want this page instead of this
00:10:32.839 page so here's top three choose which
00:10:34.839 one you want to go to and like make it
00:10:37.160 stupid simple for people when you I've
00:10:39.800 seen too many companies that actually
00:10:41.680 have like business people that go put in
00:10:44.680 redirects and do you want to guess how
00:10:46.639 often that goes wrong it is a
00:10:50.760 lot so I I would make this a simple as
00:10:53.839 possible for people and it can basic it
00:10:55.760 can be fully automated it can be
00:10:57.760 partially automated with like approvals
00:11:00.000 or whatever you need to do to actually
00:11:01.360 get it
00:11:03.959 through so what should you care
00:11:07.399 about page is not indexed it should
00:11:10.200 be not indexed you're not going to get
00:11:12.720 traffic simple internal
00:11:16.279 links by the way my slides I have been
00:11:19.760 busy organizing this so I did not get a
00:11:22.200 chance to do
00:11:23.880 design whatsoever finish these like
00:11:27.880 yesterday I'm the bad one here um maybe
00:11:32.320 like page level no follow I'm typically
00:11:34.560 not a fan if you know follow a page at
00:11:38.000 the page level all the internal links
00:11:40.200 get no followed uh if it's user
00:11:44.040 generated content on the page maybe I
00:11:46.279 want to do that but we really don't even
00:11:48.560 know how Google is treating these
00:11:49.880 anymore this is the fun thing Gary yes
00:11:52.000 years ago was like oh yeah we're going
00:11:53.560 to like start following no follow and
00:11:55.079 he's like well if we ever start like
00:11:56.440 counting the
00:11:57.680 links then we'll tell the SEO community
00:12:00.720 and he's like yeah I never asked them
00:12:02.800 about
00:12:04.519 that so do they count no follow links
00:12:07.920 they might now but until someone over
00:12:10.360 there actually goes and asks he's
00:12:12.639 supposed to tell us but until he asks we
00:12:15.399 don't
00:12:17.920 know redir I'm a big fan of redirect why
00:12:21.720 did you know how much money people spend
00:12:23.320 on like link building link acquisition
00:12:25.279 digital PR all those links go to these
00:12:27.680 pages and then two years later someone's
00:12:29.040 like let's just delete that page and all
00:12:31.240 the links go bye-bye easy easy
00:12:36.320 win hre langing some hre langing issues
00:12:40.639 can be very expensive I had won with a
00:12:43.279 lot of other contributing factors
00:12:44.720 terrible business logic people landed on
00:12:46.920 the wrong country forms were not
00:12:50.000 forwarded lot lots of bad things um it
00:12:54.000 was on an e-commerce site and it was
00:12:55.639 losing about $6.5 million do a day like
00:12:58.760 they couldn't check
00:13:00.320 out they go there and they're like you
00:13:02.639 can't use this and we're like well
00:13:04.600 simple thing was first like let's just
00:13:06.399 try like get people to the right place
00:13:07.959 or throw up a thing you're in the wrong
00:13:09.600 country uh but yeah the checkout would
00:13:11.920 not work on these four people in the
00:13:13.720 wrong country so $6.5 million a day that
00:13:18.279 issue broke across like 120 some
00:13:21.240 thousand pages and took about 8 months
00:13:23.839 to clear up from after everything was
00:13:27.160 fixed you know this is this is one of
00:13:29.360 those things where they're like can you
00:13:30.720 just call someone at Google no
00:13:34.399 no sorry all the work for fixing it was
00:13:37.880 done within like a day and we just had
00:13:39.839 to wait months for everything to be
00:13:42.040 recrawled and fixed but that was that
00:13:44.519 was massively painful painful for me too
00:13:48.000 because
00:13:49.720 everyone sorry it's fixed I promise but
00:13:52.279 you have to
00:13:55.040 wait there's a lot of JavaScript issues
00:13:57.800 probably the biggest one that would
00:13:59.320 things like your your content not being
00:14:00.839 loaded in the Dawn by default
00:14:06.199 anyway we are absolutely in exciting
00:14:09.720 times I hope y have seen that with all
00:14:11.240 this AI everything here the world is
00:14:15.959 changing we're at the very start of this
00:14:19.120 really but it's already changing
00:14:22.759 fast I'm pretty excited to see like
00:14:25.680 what's actually going to happen next
00:14:27.800 where where this is all going to go
00:14:31.519 anyone can prototype new ideas you have
00:14:34.639 an idea before you have to like oh I
00:14:36.759 need to like learn some coding and blah
00:14:38.360 blah blah and go build this I used to be
00:14:40.399 a developer I built like lots of stuff
00:14:42.240 that redirect script bunch of things
00:14:45.040 um the last three things I built I would
00:14:48.360 have estimated well let's just take one
00:14:52.040 uh I would have estimated 12 to 14 hours
00:14:54.240 for me to like sit down code that get
00:14:56.079 everything trouble so it work took me 45
00:14:58.680 minutes like four revisions which CH GPT
00:15:01.079 and I had working
00:15:03.399 code uh is that the best no does it work
00:15:07.000 yes it can be slow it may not handle
00:15:09.519 like large data sets but just as a proof
00:15:11.680 of concept or if you got time to wait

00:15:33.440 now like we're going to we're literally
00:15:35.880 using that it's going to be basically
00:15:38.880 you make a change on the page it
00:15:41.000 notifies index now that notifies us we
00:15:43.079 go crawl the page like seconds later
00:15:45.759 then we can tell you if you screwed
00:15:47.319 something up literally seconds after
00:15:49.839 that W but what do you do with that like
00:15:53.360 there just yeah faster notifications

00:15:59.000 JavaScript JavaScript has better support
00:16:01.519 Cloud flare workers really cool let you
00:16:03.319 change all the code on the page before
00:16:06.120 it's ever served to bots are
00:16:08.079 users can youall see where I'm going
00:16:09.920 with this
00:16:14.959 yet there's a thing that got titled Edge
00:16:18.199 SEO by a guy named uh Dan Taylor I still
00:16:20.880 argue it should be serverless SEO that's
00:16:22.800 okay it's okay it's okay uh you can
00:16:27.279 automate practically everything uh I'm
00:16:30.319 I'm actually convinced uh that about 95%
00:16:34.279 of tech SEO issues all those things I
00:16:36.120 don't care about imagine having a system
00:16:38.360 that's just like here are all these
00:16:39.959 things that you're never going to assign
00:16:41.199 anyone to fix click a button say I want
00:16:44.639 to fix
00:16:46.079 those it's a lot of AI scripts and stuff
00:16:49.000 that you could literally automate like
00:16:50.399 oh I need to like do 20,000 meta
00:16:53.399 descriptions okay like let me give an
00:16:54.920 intern like 2 months or let me click a
00:16:57.160 button 2 minutes later the AI is done
00:17:00.120 click a button boom
00:17:03.439 implemented I got 10,000 Pages marked no
00:17:06.160 index oh I should be index click a
00:17:08.679 button
00:17:10.039 indexed we are there we've been there
00:17:13.280 for years this has been
00:17:16.199 possible we have a system coming that's
00:17:18.359 going to do this by the way it's called
00:17:19.959 patches it's going to be
00:17:25.599 awesome so I have some ideas about what
