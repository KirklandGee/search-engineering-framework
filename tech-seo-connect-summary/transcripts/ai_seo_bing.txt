00:00:29.199 wonderful conference
00:00:30.519 so I will tell you about uh Microsoft
00:00:33.440 Bing and really what you have to think
00:00:35.840 about the new area SEO for the AI area
00:00:40.879 let's get started uh we'll cover AI we
00:00:44.239 cover bigma master tool we'll tell you a
00:00:46.399 lot about an next no in this technical
00:00:48.520 SEO conference and some goodies for me
00:00:51.760 more from
00:00:52.879 beinging um my mission had been is
00:00:55.760 really to create the world best index uh
00:00:58.559 to satisfy all user so I download your
00:01:02.559 site each and every day and if a content
00:01:04.879 is missing from being sear results my
00:01:07.680 that's my fault bad for me please do not
00:01:10.040 contact me uh and really this is all
00:01:13.400 about uh discovering the best content on
00:01:15.799 the internet selecting it downloading it
00:01:18.479 processing it and maybe saving it and
00:01:20.680 annexing it so um but it's far more than
00:01:25.960 that mean that it's not only the Blue
00:01:28.200 Links it's also everything about AI
00:01:30.720 everything about calot or uh AI
00:01:34.720 experience this is also about the uh
00:01:38.720 image search video search this is also
00:01:42.280 about advertising where we validate
00:01:44.320 content this is about news uh this is
00:01:47.159 about everything you gave me everything
00:01:49.960 we download is processed by my
00:01:52.280 team um and we can go to news we can go
00:01:57.360 to advertising yes when you do an ad
00:01:59.880 advertising at beinging and Microsoft
00:02:02.200 advertising it's verified by my team in
00:02:04.320 term of quality but being is way bigger
00:02:07.640 than people think it's we are also
00:02:09.959 powering DDO we are powering yaho H skoa
00:02:14.680 but we are also providing search and
00:02:17.360 some AI things to meta open Ai and
00:02:21.480 swisco and many many others cannot list
00:02:24.800 them whole so when you see being in your
00:02:28.760 log that's great but when you think
00:02:31.280 about it there is far more uh engine
00:02:35.800 that you may not be counting as being so
00:02:38.720 being is way bigger than you think even
00:02:41.560 bigger there says in Windows billions of
00:02:44.800 user we are all over Windows obviously
00:02:48.200 and here you can find Bing results if
00:02:50.840 you just search from the start bar you
00:02:52.840 can find Bing everywhere and this
00:02:55.400 unfortunately won't be counted as a
00:02:57.680 traffic to your sites because there is
00:03:00.239 no referer windows but it's still being
00:03:04.280 powering this experience so we are
00:03:06.400 somehow in lot of places surfacing not
00:03:09.799 only at Bing but also elsewhere think
00:03:12.120 about that when you think
00:03:14.599 SEO next is the past of AI Innovation is
00:03:19.000 really exponential that's crazy I cannot
00:03:21.959 catch up with everything that is
00:03:23.799 happening at in AI a lot is happening
00:03:26.680 each and every day and even more each
00:03:28.920 and every hour now this is really really
00:03:31.720 speeding up not only what's happened in
00:03:34.159 the past uh but even more these days all
00:03:38.519 this innovation in AI trigger that okay
00:03:42.799 rele search engine come up with AI
00:03:45.640 augmented solution such as in 2023 being
00:03:49.920 augmented with this shat no name calot
00:03:53.959 to really offer customer the ability to
00:03:57.040 go deeper to search better to find
00:04:00.079 content that they maybe were not able to
00:04:02.280 find until this day over search engine
00:04:05.599 as Google follow and now we have ai that
00:04:08.680 is surfacing everywhere not only as
00:04:11.360 generated AI as caption as shat all of
00:04:17.279 uh experiences search experiences you
00:04:20.040 can find this uh content surfacing and
00:04:23.520 this experiences surfacing so truly
00:04:26.320 amazing keep we keep innovating we keep
00:04:29.960 iterating on this
00:04:33.160 experiences so in 2023 this is really
00:04:37.000 the the time when we we enable really
00:04:41.560 some some crazy Innovative experiences
00:04:43.919 to the user you are all part of Techo
00:04:47.000 you are all Savvy Tech you know what we
00:04:49.919 are talking about but think about it
00:04:51.880 millions of user that were really so far
00:04:55.000 experiencing only 10 Blue Links okay
00:04:57.919 they got a shot experience what's that
00:05:00.639 they got really experiences that were uh
00:05:03.360 really new and Innovative for them so
00:05:05.800 this is where search engine not only are
00:05:07.759 displaying things but they are also uh
00:05:10.199 learning from user and as we learn from
00:05:12.360 user we are optimizing this experiences
00:05:14.400 to obviously satisfy the user and so TW
00:05:17.600 we saw this kind of learning curve and
00:05:20.520 really people were saying okay what is
00:05:22.400 that I'm lost maybe I will click back I
00:05:24.160 will go back to sech results and as we
00:05:26.120 discover that it was very useful this
00:05:28.440 kind of set experience we saw even more
00:05:31.440 traffic coming to the shat as we we
00:05:33.880 improving also the quality the layout
00:05:35.800 the display This was um they were
00:05:38.400 maximizing um results on this
00:05:41.120 experiences and so 2024 is we saw that
00:05:44.919 people were sticking to it we're really
00:05:46.840 loving it and continue to use
00:05:51.120 that so there is really two two kind of
00:05:54.600 searches and two kind of EX what people
00:05:57.759 are doing in Search and let's say copot
00:06:00.680 and AI shat
00:06:03.319 experiences so think about it this is if
00:06:06.479 you search for YouTube you go to
00:06:08.840 youtube.com you really need to you
00:06:11.240 really don't need to have an experience
00:06:13.520 that is uh chat experience augmented AI
00:06:17.360 augmented this is what we call
00:06:19.240 navigational queries you query for
00:06:21.479 something you get what you want you
00:06:23.880 click the link you are gone you are
00:06:26.000 happy you are satisfied by this query
00:06:28.479 it's kind of what SE is doing this is we
00:06:31.039 try to Max minimize the number of uh the
00:06:34.160 time from the query to the click to the
00:06:36.680 good quality site if we can satisfy the
00:06:39.240 query in one click perfect we are really
00:06:41.560 happy uh about this kind of experience
00:06:44.800 then there is uh kind of copal lot where
00:06:48.120 often the user does not really know what
00:06:50.400 he or she is looking for and will kind
00:06:52.919 of potentially iterate and this is where
00:06:55.720 we can really engage a discussion
00:06:57.680 conversation with a user to be able to
00:07:00.440 find the best content and also to to
00:07:03.280 Really Le this kind of complex query
00:07:06.199 that search may not be able to answer so
00:07:09.080 you can do such crazy very very long
00:07:12.080 query in calot and we will provide
00:07:14.080 content that is satisfying this query
00:07:16.199 leveraging the best of AI Tech we have
00:07:18.680 to release yourface content and links to
00:07:21.520 your sites enabling you uh to get
00:07:24.080 traffic from suchar experience so search
00:07:27.919 I know exactly what I want want and
00:07:30.840 copal lot story AI story where I S I
00:07:33.400 know what I want and maybe I will
00:07:34.800 iterate or the engine the AI engine will
00:07:37.280 be smart enough to really provide on the
00:07:39.759 first results this ideal
00:07:43.479 content so next is really Su is not
00:07:48.520 dead this say we keep telling that for
00:07:51.240 years it's really evolving and it's
00:07:54.440 evolving in a direction that is some
00:07:57.360 very interesting this is where there is
00:07:59.039 a diversification there is more uh
00:08:02.840 solution out there to provide
00:08:05.360 fundamentally traffic qualified traffic
00:08:07.800 to your sites so this is not only uh
00:08:11.440 search as usual this is AI this is
00:08:14.680 various solution being copal lot thiss
00:08:17.080 is perplexity thiss is open AI this is
00:08:19.400 all this AI solution thiss is maybe Tik
00:08:21.759 Tok and others that are providing
00:08:24.159 traffic to your sites so something to
00:08:27.280 really consider there is more player
00:08:29.919 more players that are driving additional
00:08:32.599 traffic to your site sometime it's they
00:08:35.240 are draining a little bit from search
00:08:36.760 engine if not a more lot more they says
00:08:39.679 also that there is overall driving more
00:08:42.399 traffic overall to sides so something to
00:08:46.120 consider optimizing for one player is
00:08:48.720 maybe not what you should focus on
00:08:50.959 moving
00:08:52.040 forward um we are on the east coast and
00:08:54.800 I want to say I want to allight someone
00:08:57.399 on the east coast in Philadelphia we're
00:08:58.880 speaking about Phil
00:09:00.200 yesterday and um will has some good
00:09:04.200 insights about what's happening in the
00:09:05.720 industry this day there is over players
00:09:08.399 that are also detecting that mean they
00:09:12.480 detect that there is clicks from search
00:09:16.079 and there is clicks from AI solution and
00:09:19.839 what he really care about is really
00:09:23.440 about getting not clicks getting
00:09:26.519 conversion getting dollar value from
00:09:30.120 search and from Ai and what he observed
00:09:34.079 he really went deep I was speaking to
00:09:36.360 him two days ago and he really went deep
00:09:38.399 in data and showing me that AI is
00:09:42.839 generating absolutely Stellar clicks
00:09:46.160 absolutely mean when I say Stellar this
00:09:48.600 is things that are converting to
00:09:50.360 registration to an event to registration
00:09:53.360 to a newsletter to people buying things
00:09:57.000 click is often exploration
00:09:59.839 is a click okay link number one click
00:10:03.320 link number two go back iterate often
00:10:06.880 what people as we are observing is that
00:10:09.240 and this is one of them I've got many
00:10:11.399 example where people are observing more
00:10:13.399 quality clicks from AI
00:10:17.920 solution so I did this graph it's not
00:10:22.120 the best graph but fundamentally look at
00:10:24.440 2D motion look at clicks of I see suu
00:10:28.600 and it's very thing to do this says okay
00:10:30.920 you go to your meetings to say hey look
00:10:33.279 the clicks is moving up it's good
00:10:36.040 personally I I think you should not care
00:10:38.959 so much about clicks you should look
00:10:41.560 really at conversion rate about the
00:10:43.240 dollar value that really there clicks
00:10:45.800 are adding and so you can see really
00:10:48.360 there's two Dimension one is about oh
00:10:50.680 you may have a lot of clicks on search
00:10:52.920 but maybe you may not have enough
00:10:54.959 conversion you may not have people that
00:10:56.839 are buying something on your shopping s
00:10:58.959 and so on so really look at two this two
00:11:02.279 Dimension because if you go to the CMO
00:11:05.639 CEO to tell I've got lot of clicks and
00:11:09.040 you go back next day to say no no I've
00:11:11.000 got a dollar coming from this clicks
00:11:14.480 this is better for your career to save
00:11:16.399 the second one than the first one so
00:11:19.120 think about that ideally try to plot
00:11:21.399 that come back to the industry telling a
00:11:23.760 that's fact we may have less clicks from
00:11:27.000 AI but we have far better clicks from a
00:11:29.440 I than from search we obviously still
00:11:32.440 want to have great search results it's
00:11:34.920 not about diminishing the value of
00:11:36.760 search but there is also a real value of
00:11:40.279 AI so next is I want to briefly
00:11:43.800 introduce you being generated search and
00:11:46.399 tell you more about it because what we
00:11:48.800 saw is that there is search and AI but
00:11:51.560 maybe maybe there is a way to do the
00:11:53.519 best of both world uh to again trigger
00:11:57.200 uh very good links and clicks to your s
00:11:59.519 sites so if you search ad beinging today
00:12:02.839 for what is a spaghetti western movie
00:12:05.360 think you will see a very long and
00:12:08.680 complex
00:12:10.200 experience very long search result page
00:12:13.079 with lot of information in it such as
00:12:16.360 movies about this Western PTI J J and
00:12:21.120 many more so the experience is really
00:12:23.440 about fundamentally this is we know that
00:12:26.920 there is not one good results for this
00:12:28.760 query
00:12:29.800 there is a set of things that people are
00:12:31.880 looking at when they search for that so
00:12:34.920 we can really explore and provide
00:12:37.399 information directly on the search
00:12:39.440 result page with a long list of
00:12:41.839 categories and answers that may satisfy
00:12:44.320 the user it's kind of a magazine thing
00:12:47.040 it's kind of a lot of information
00:12:48.760 provided to the user but we perceived
00:12:52.040 from the data analytic we have that it's
00:12:55.120 really the best results we can provide
00:12:56.959 to the user understanding we understand
00:12:59.959 the user the history what user are Weare
00:13:02.240 doing and providing the best user
00:13:04.720 friendly experience to the user it's
00:13:07.240 kind of thinking already what the user
00:13:09.440 will click next and based on what they
00:13:11.440 have done in the past providing again
00:13:13.279 this best experience to the user it's
00:13:14.959 kind of mixing AI where the layout and
00:13:18.399 the placement of all this answer is
00:13:20.320 really uh based on uh what we believe
00:13:23.399 should be it's never the same you will
00:13:26.000 see different experiences for the
00:13:27.800 generated search
00:13:29.720 um this is using the llm using a lot of
00:13:33.079 tech to again provide the best answer uh
00:13:35.760 to the
00:13:37.040 user you can try generated search by
00:13:40.120 just querying for being generated search
00:13:43.639 and you will see a carousel with lot of
00:13:45.880 links to try it out so encouraging you
00:13:49.320 to play with it this is kind of a future
00:13:51.360 of search this is where AI is really
00:13:53.560 coming in the search results to really
00:13:55.959 kind of potentially change the 10 Blue
00:13:57.880 Links to provide a generated AI
00:14:00.680 experience that is not only the
00:14:02.639 placement of information is completely
00:14:04.480 based on AI the links themselves may be
00:14:07.079 caption generated AI generated lot of AI
00:14:10.040 in play for such
00:14:13.000 Pages um and you can test that also you
00:14:15.839 can also observe that sometime we you
00:14:18.320 may display the Deep search button so
00:14:21.320 the Deep search is something that is
00:14:23.920 absolutely some more fascinating this SV
00:14:27.360 this is this is not fast this is not one
00:14:30.480 millisec to get the results why because
00:14:33.560 we will do deep search we will go deep
00:14:36.120 in the stock we will run llm models we
00:14:38.480 will do a lot of things to often
00:14:40.959 generate this kind of experience on the
00:14:42.759 fly to really try to satisfy this this
00:14:46.560 query this to surface uh really quality
00:14:50.360 content it it crazy expensive in term of
00:14:54.839 CPU AI logic to really go deep in the
00:14:58.639 stock to to really retrieve uh this
00:15:00.560 content and try to satisfy the query so
00:15:04.279 I let you play with this we think it's
00:15:07.040 the some also the future of search and
00:15:09.120 obviously as we are optimizing Tech this
00:15:12.000 is to bring this technology in the
00:15:14.600 search page in the default page as
00:15:17.360 needed to again satisfy this query where
00:15:20.480 the default may be not satisfactory or
00:15:22.480 we believe we should uh iterate more to
00:15:24.680 display relevant
00:15:26.480 results next is I want to tell you about
00:15:29.519 uh being we master tool a little bit
00:15:31.440 about what we release uh what we are
00:15:33.920 releasing this week so being we master
00:15:36.959 tool is fundamentally a tool to free
00:15:39.199 tool to help you to get more user to
00:15:41.519 your sites to to tell you what's wrong
00:15:44.240 on your sites or give you abilities to
00:15:46.959 to understand what we want you to do to
00:15:49.240 get more user so the SE is often very
00:15:54.040 difficult this is why you are here uh if
00:15:57.040 it was easy yes but this was easy and
00:15:59.880 you don't need to be there and you won't
00:16:01.680 have a job so no you are here why
00:16:03.560 because there is Su and it's difficult
00:16:06.639 it's difficult because there is a lot of
00:16:08.440 data a ton of data you have data that
00:16:11.800 often you are looking at Google SCE
00:16:13.519 console sometime being we master tool
00:16:15.920 you have logs we spoke about logs
00:16:17.759 yesterday in passing logs there is a ton
00:16:19.600 of data everywhere
00:16:21.360 available and next is that there is a
00:16:23.920 lot of tools look at all the tools
00:16:26.079 yesterday which tool I need to use and
00:16:28.519 here we have
00:16:29.680 uh we believe that we can help you and
00:16:33.040 uh so this is Major announcement this is
00:16:35.920 the this is a case stud this is uh maybe
00:16:39.279 someday this will happen in your life

00:23:28.960 will spend a little bit time on andex
00:23:32.520 no why andex no why this is so critical
00:23:36.120 for um not only for being but of over
00:23:40.919 search engine so what's happening with
00:23:43.760 search engine is that we are dumb I will
00:23:48.200 be clear in calling you see Google
00:23:51.520 speaking about calling and optimizing
00:23:53.720 HTTP download and whatever the fact is
00:23:58.080 that we really don't know what's
00:24:00.679 happening on website at scale we may
00:24:03.720 know what's happening on some head URL
00:24:07.080 homepages and think like this if you
00:24:09.480 have a sites with billions of URL of
00:24:11.760 Amazon sorry I simply don't know if as a
00:24:15.320 certain gen if a t product a really
00:24:19.200 small product has been updated price has
00:24:21.200 been updated so what we do is we send
00:24:24.240 simply send the Coler to see if we are
00:24:27.840 lucky
00:24:28.880 if something has changed or not or if
00:24:31.399 there is a new URL a new outlink helping
00:24:33.960 us to discover the
00:24:35.960 content that's dumb they says then you
00:24:40.240 are
00:24:41.000 surfacing problems as C
00:24:44.240 quter okay what's stupid so the view the
00:24:49.840 view what we want to do is really move
00:24:52.120 to a model where uh search engine will
00:24:55.360 be augmented via an API
00:24:58.880 to tell us what
00:25:01.360 change and so this is as easy as you
00:25:04.159 submit an
00:25:05.480 URL and I trust you I come with a
00:25:09.600 color and thank you I download the
00:25:13.399 content Bingo the latest content is
00:25:16.039 reflected in the search
00:25:18.200 engine no more quala no more craziness I
00:25:21.799 can allocate lot of processing capacity
00:25:26.559 JavaScript processings and so on on to
00:25:28.760 this URL that has just been downloaded
00:25:30.799 because you are telling me that the
00:25:32.240 content has changed great thank you I
00:25:35.120 can benefit from that here is a
00:25:37.559 two-minute video to tell you more about
00:25:39.320 an next in the ever evolving digital
00:25:41.559 landscape leaning Brands like Yahoo eBay

00:25:49.919 index now to enhance their online
00:25:52.000 presence this is more than a trend it's
00:25:54.880 a GameChanger without index Now search
00:25:57.840 engines crawl websites at their own pace
00:26:00.279 not when site owners publish new content
00:26:03.000 these unpredictable crawlers can miss
00:26:04.760 newly published content for hours or
00:26:07.159 even days this means Searchers are
00:26:09.440 unable to benefit from your latest
00:26:11.760 product listings press releases or other
00:26:14.440 important content and without the
00:26:15.919 ability to control when and what content
00:26:18.640 is indexed search results captions can
00:26:21.320 appear outdated and lower your site's
00:26:23.240 rankings by sending customers to wrong
00:26:25.640 or broken links this leads to mismatched
00:26:28.039 cont content and frustrated Searchers

00:27:12.720 reducing crawl cost having better online

00:27:27.640 management systems and Cloud delivery
00:27:29.600 networks already support index Now by
00:27:31.760 default requiring little to no effort on
00:27:34.880 your part to learn how you can adopt
00:27:36.720 index now simply visit

00:27:54.120 information about how to convince your
00:27:55.840 boss uh to adopt an next no
00:27:58.720 and implementation can be first your
00:28:01.480 sites may be an no enable already if you
00:28:03.640 are using a good content management
00:28:05.200 system more are coming or you have
00:28:08.399 plugins for uh the top content
00:28:10.559 measurement system so it can take you
00:28:12.039 five minutes to adopt if you are your
00:28:14.279 own stock with the index no protocol is
00:28:18.640 easy uh we see having a set of interns
00:28:22.320 last summer that did implementation for
00:28:24.519 a lot of top sites so we were very happy
00:28:27.600 to see that
00:28:28.679 but uh we offer you insights within big
00:28:32.440 master tool to help you to tell you if
00:28:34.559 you do a good job at uh publishing
00:28:37.159 content in term of added updated and
00:28:39.559 deleted
00:28:42.679 URL I want to speak a little bit about
00:28:45.519 the slides
00:28:47.640 um I do believe that theu Community is
00:28:51.399 not paying attention enough to deleted
00:28:56.720 urls
00:28:58.240 and updated
00:29:00.360 URLs so this is for anex or if you plan
00:29:05.279 adopting anex no in the future please
00:29:07.640 also pay attention today about what's
00:29:10.279 happening so the community is all about
00:29:13.760 yeah I've got my content IND next y win
00:29:17.120 no it's not a win it's just the start of
00:29:20.000 a
00:29:21.120 journey it's also the fact that you need
00:29:23.840 to think that things are changing all
00:29:25.880 the time on the Internet you may have
00:29:27.240 Oncor text coming to your URLs you may
00:29:29.720 have lot of information on the web
00:29:31.840 linking to your content but certainly
00:29:33.919 need to be aware that hey there is
00:29:36.080 additional things that is happening for
00:29:37.640 this URL please we need to reprocess
00:29:39.919 this URL we need maybe to get it
00:29:41.919 reindexed second is that yourl may be
00:29:44.720 gone from your site because you remove a
00:29:47.159 product let's imagine that the customer
00:29:49.399 click the link going to this page it's
00:29:52.679 really bad from a search engine
00:29:54.000 standpoint why because the customer
00:29:55.720 obviously won't long won't stay there it
00:29:58.120 will click back short DW time we call
00:30:01.679 that DW time of getting to the content
00:30:04.159 is bad for search engine this is a bad
00:30:06.200 signal we think your site is not
00:30:09.080 relevant so the fact that the content is
00:30:11.960 deleted if we don't drain this content
00:30:15.240 from search engine is bad so it's not
00:30:18.200 only about adding the content once it's
00:30:19.960 also about deleting removing the bad
00:30:23.559 content next
00:30:25.760 update think about this beautiful video
00:30:28.320 you just publish on YouTube about your
00:30:30.519 products great obviously if you get it
00:30:33.720 Index right away and you should this URL
00:30:36.720 will have maybe one view cont because
00:30:39.840 you've tested that this URL R fine and
00:30:42.279 yeah one view cont we don't want to link
00:30:45.360 to video having one view cont we prefer
00:30:47.840 to link to video having 1 million view
00:30:50.120 cont so as you get traffic if you don't
00:30:53.840 reflect in search engine that this video
00:30:56.000 has many view cont
00:30:58.720 then search engine will continue to
00:31:00.440 think that this video has one view count
00:31:03.320 bad so it's not only about I want to
00:31:06.799 share another example
00:31:08.639 price okay you went live with a
00:31:11.880 $255 thing but now you have a promotion
00:31:14.840 at
00:31:16.200 $99 if certain gen are not aware that
00:31:19.600 this is
00:31:20.600 $99 they may prefer the oversight that
00:31:23.679 as the price as
00:31:25.840 $99 because yeah we want to SA is by
00:31:28.240 your customer and we prefer linking to
00:31:30.440 customer to something having $99 but
00:31:32.760 something having
00:31:34.240 $255 and I can go
00:31:36.600 forever so having the latest content
00:31:40.240 index in search engine from this
00:31:42.440 technical suo audience truly
00:31:45.600 matter and then the question become okay
00:31:48.799 when I've got to send the Fe the
00:31:50.639 notification to the search
00:31:52.399 engine think this is an Amazon
00:31:55.519 page wow lot of information on the page
00:31:59.519 price reviews comments if sent us
00:32:04.080 notification for each and every change
00:32:06.399 on Amazon we will be bombarded with
00:32:08.840 billions of URL every day because yes
00:32:11.440 people are viewing sending comments
00:32:13.880 reviewing things so you need to think
00:32:16.399 about a strategy SEO strategy to know
00:32:19.559 when to notify the search engine clearly
00:32:22.720 I did URL right away deleted URL right
00:32:26.639 away and then the tricky question is
00:32:29.120 really about when do you want to notify
00:32:31.519 for the update and so I did a blog post
00:32:34.840 to provide some view it's really think
00:32:38.919 about that as generic then you need to
00:32:41.120 adopt that for your sites to know when
00:32:43.880 to notify search engine being Andover
00:32:47.760 the benefit of anx no is that with anx
00:32:50.480 no you will notify all search engine
00:32:52.519 having adopting an xn I do believe this
00:32:55.519 is something that is very important from
00:32:57.360 a ranking
00:32:58.440 to satisfy customer in search engine and
00:33:00.919 so pay attention to
00:33:04.320 this and next no is really getting uh
00:33:08.639 adoption um we are very pleased at
00:33:11.639 Microsoft to see that and over search
00:33:13.440 engine are observing the same we do
00:33:17.320 believe that there is a path toward uh
00:33:20.320 nearly all search engine including the
00:33:22.840 very big one adopting an xn so we
