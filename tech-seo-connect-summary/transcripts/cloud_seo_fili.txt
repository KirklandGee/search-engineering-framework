00:00:06.279 hello everyone yep it is working very
00:00:10.160 good hey it's an absolute pleasure to be
00:00:12.080 here today and yes I am going to be
00:00:14.280 talking today about SEO obviously H as
00:00:18.000 well as how to do it in the cloud now
00:00:19.960 just quick disclaimer uh it will go fast
00:00:23.560 uh no wor there will be notes after if
00:00:25.240 you want to contact me and uh very
00:00:27.560 simple uh this is not everything this is
00:00:29.759 just
00:00:30.480 a touch of what can go wrong among
00:00:32.558 others and some things I hope that you
00:00:34.960 have not thought about that you will now
00:00:36.600 have to check on Monday morning when
00:00:38.120 you're back in the office so a couple of
00:00:40.039 things that we'll be aiming at is of
00:00:41.440 course improving uh crawling for BTS as
00:00:44.079 well as uh the indexing process as well
00:00:46.480 as speed for your website now with that
00:00:49.120 we hope of course that we also improve
00:00:51.280 your rankings as well as in the end your
00:00:53.680 turn out for sales now here comes a big
00:00:57.239 question what's the problem right um
00:01:00.160 first of all Google has publicly said
00:01:02.879 that they approximate about 60% of the
00:01:04.839 web is duplicate that is a big big
00:01:08.159 number and with that we are
00:01:10.960 unintentionally playing a tug of war
00:01:13.439 with our own content and that's a
00:01:15.680 problem when we have Cloud Solutions now
00:01:18.040 you might be going like what the hell is
00:01:19.400 he talking about yeah sure um it all
00:01:22.119 starts with the URL now everyone knows
00:01:24.720 how Ur is scheduled or sorry build up at
00:01:28.000 least I'm hoping here that you guys do
00:01:30.079 because this is a technical SEO
00:01:31.520 conference you should know this part um
00:01:34.119 but yeah we have the basics you know
00:01:36.280 like Hello uh we contact uh we access a
00:01:39.479 URL we have an HP request then we get a
00:01:41.640 response and we get status codes now for
00:01:43.759 SEO the two most relevant uh status
00:01:46.600 codes are of course the 200 and the 404
00:01:49.119 I'm putting the 410 with the 404 because
00:01:51.479 Google kind of sees them as the same now
00:01:53.439 you might be asking about how about the
00:01:55.119 tri ones right aren't they well actually
00:01:58.399 no yes and no they kind of our hack
00:02:01.240 they're are workaround they're not
00:02:03.840 really URL because it's like moving
00:02:06.799 house and Burning Down The House where
00:02:08.239 you were yeah where you previous lived
00:02:10.800 so it's kind of a hack to get to the new
00:02:12.760 place um and it's important to keep that
00:02:15.640 in mind because every change to our URL
00:02:19.080 we see as a change is actually a side
00:02:21.239 move from one to the other and it's
00:02:23.519 important to keep in mind that URLs are
00:02:25.280 immutable so in other words once you
00:02:27.120 create them the only other thing you can
00:02:28.480 do is delete them that's where that four
00:02:30.519 or four status code come in yeah now how
00:02:34.319 do we see URLs or how should we see URLs
00:02:37.400 we we should see URLs as database row
00:02:40.360 IDs so when you work with databases I
00:02:43.480 hope some of you kind of do uh you may
00:02:46.040 know you put a row in the database you
00:02:48.640 may change the data on that row but the
00:02:52.400 one field you never change is the ID you
00:02:55.480 create the ID you delete the row you
00:02:57.760 delete the ID that's it URLs are similar
00:03:01.720 yeah that's an important concept that a
00:03:03.599 lot of people don't think about and the
00:03:06.959 reason why I'm mentioning it is also
00:03:09.040 here Google uses that ID to in the URL
00:03:12.319 inspection tool as the ID this is why on
00:03:15.080 top of search console it's not anything
00:03:17.560 else but the full URL because that's the
00:03:20.720 identifier yeah
00:03:23.920 now John muu said this a few years ago
00:03:27.120 very aply I must honestly say he's not
00:03:29.200 the first one to say not the last one to
00:03:30.640 say the whole internet is based on this
00:03:32.439 concept on the worldwide web at least uh
00:03:34.799 one eurl uh per piece of content a URL
00:03:38.519 is an identifier for that piece of
00:03:41.599 content I really want you guys to keep
00:03:44.560 that in the back of your mind going
00:03:46.280 forward because I come across too many
00:03:48.239 esos that don't realize that yeah and we
00:03:51.400 see too much duplication because of that
00:03:55.040 way too much duplication and this
00:03:57.480 impacts our content signals which if you
00:04:00.439 look at all the updates that Google has
00:04:02.040 pushed in the last few years or actually
00:04:03.599 the last decade plus a lot of them are
00:04:05.799 content quality related so that comes
00:04:08.239 back to this yeah now let's uh talk
00:04:11.319 about how to get this right because this
00:04:12.720 is the meat of the thing this is what we
00:04:14.079 really care for so one very quickly we
00:04:16.519 need to know our host names now of
00:04:19.079 course we can go to Google Search
00:04:20.880 console add our uh domain as a uh as a
00:04:23.520 domain property and maybe see some of
00:04:25.560 the host names that Google is crawling
00:04:27.680 some of the subdomains now you may have
00:04:29.160 done that you may have not done that I
00:04:30.520 hope you have because you may see
00:04:32.680 subdomains there that you did not know
00:04:34.280 that Google was crawling yeah big by the
00:04:37.400 way gives you that data to a certain
00:04:39.280 extent as well in the in the site
00:04:41.160 Explorer but you also want to look at
00:04:42.960 your name server and double check that
00:04:45.800 see what's going on there do you have C
00:04:47.600 names do you have a records do you have
00:04:49.440 duple a records double check that um
00:04:52.000 look for duplication here we want to for
00:04:54.400 example look for staging and depth
00:04:55.880 development uh situations here is
00:04:58.160 Walmart with two simple staging
00:05:01.080 subdomains I'm not sure the IT team is
00:05:03.320 happy that this is out and the SEO team
00:05:04.960 most definitely should not be happy that
00:05:06.639 this is public and indexable yeah um now
00:05:09.919 note that I said earlier know your host
00:05:12.120 name but I did not say know your
00:05:15.039 subdomains yeah very important
00:05:16.919 distinction why because it's not about
00:05:19.720 stuff on your domain only with Cloud
00:05:21.680 Solutions we're actually now talking off
00:05:23.360 domain as well yeah and here simple
00:05:27.240 example uh two examples actually of two
00:05:29.240 websites that have a the first one is
00:05:31.560 development website and the other one is
00:05:33.240 a staging website now and the first one
00:05:36.199 is a bank now if we go to the original
00:05:38.720 website of the bank we can actually see
00:05:40.479 that both the development and the and
00:05:43.280 the original website are returning to
00:05:45.720 status code they're both
00:05:48.560 indexed great do you think that's
00:05:51.199 competing do you think it's safe for
00:05:53.319 users to go to the wp engine version and
00:05:57.160 log in there yeah see see the issues
00:06:00.199 here yeah this is in the cloud and now
00:06:02.319 it's not just for security it's also for
00:06:04.600 competing content we want to limit that
00:06:06.880 duplication part now second we also need
00:06:10.479 to know which URLs Bots are accessing on
00:06:13.960 our website now of course we have craw
00:06:15.800 stats and yes we can see there a little
00:06:17.960 bit at least um Jory will talk about
00:06:20.479 this more later but we can see uh what
00:06:23.160 type of BS are being accessed um from
00:06:25.720 Google and what the status codes are the
00:06:27.639 more interesting parts for me though is
00:06:30.199 this particular one uh this table where
00:06:32.800 we can see by file type if you look at
00:06:34.440 the first one and for the ones in the
00:06:35.840 back that can't see it this is 80%
00:06:38.880 87% of in of HTML files the other one is
00:06:42.479 16 yeah the majority of the content that
00:06:45.759 is indexable is on HTML meaning that in
00:06:49.120 this case 51% on the other case is
00:06:51.440 basically wasted craw budget that's
00:06:53.199 something we want to be aware of now the
00:06:54.759 problem is that uh oh yeah and you can
00:06:56.879 also use of course the other reports
00:06:58.240 like this one you might see some
00:06:59.599 interesting data there the important the
00:07:02.360 the problem is that this is just sample
00:07:03.879 data this is not the full
00:07:06.479 picture we do need the full picture to
00:07:08.840 make better decisions so then we need to
00:07:11.000 go to our server logs and we need to ask
00:07:13.599 ourselves are we recording the right
00:07:15.240 data because very often we're not and
00:07:18.000 double check that with your it team um
00:07:20.639 here's a simplified version of a part
00:07:22.879 common log file format the user agent
00:07:25.599 for condensity purposes I've taken off
00:07:27.720 but everything else should be there in
00:07:28.960 principle and we can see the Slash and
00:07:30.720 we can see a 200 status code right now
00:07:33.680 here we have the next line or a few
00:07:35.240 lines down and we see again the Slash
00:07:38.919 the root and the 301 what's going on
00:07:41.080 here why do we have two different status
00:07:42.840 codes for the same slash for the root
00:07:46.960 right this can happen in our log files
00:07:49.159 well the reason is because one is the
00:07:51.120 https on the root and the other one is
00:07:53.319 the
00:07:54.000 HTTP but we did not record that
00:07:56.400 distinction in our log file so now we
00:07:58.240 don't know we also didn't know if this
00:08:00.520 was maybe the
00:08:01.840 www yeah versus The Naked domain so
00:08:04.440 these are things that you need to record
00:08:06.240 and the standard log files do not record
00:08:08.400 that so make sure that you include the
00:08:11.560 origin of every URL that uh you record
00:08:15.199 in your log files so in other words the
00:08:17.680 full absolute URL you need to be able to
00:08:19.520 reconstruct it I don't care if you file
00:08:21.440 it as a separate field or as the full
00:08:23.560 you absolute URL but get the
00:08:25.960 data because otherwise you don't have
00:08:28.479 the data as simple as that
00:08:30.159 you may think you have but you don't
00:08:32.000 also collect all of it because if you
00:08:34.000 work in techn SEO especially with Cloud
00:08:35.760 Solutions how about the CDN how about
00:08:38.399 the low balancer do you have those log
00:08:40.200 files too you need to because the the
00:08:43.599 the user might actually never reach your
00:08:45.000 server and you still need that request
00:08:46.720 same for Google bot yeah you need to get
00:08:49.480 that data um and if you don't or if you
00:08:52.440 don't record all the relevant data um
00:08:55.320 it's like playing go when half the board
00:08:58.240 is invisible to you yeah you're not
00:09:00.839 going to be able to good to make good
00:09:02.680 business decision or SEO strategy
00:09:04.320 decisions going forward you have
00:09:06.120 impartial data uh or partial data I
00:09:08.880 should actually say not impartial
00:09:09.920 partial now number three another problem
00:09:13.440 I often see is uh blocking Bots with
00:09:17.800 firewalls uh see a lot of sites that are
00:09:20.079 aggressively proactively blocking Bots
00:09:22.320 and with that um yeah you do need to
00:09:24.680 double check that you're not
00:09:25.640 accidentally accidentally blocking
00:09:27.519 Google bot because uh if even these B
00:09:30.440 protection services that are being sold
00:09:32.519 out there they don't get it right yeah
00:09:34.680 not always so you may be accidentally
00:09:36.600 blocking Google B which is something
00:09:38.320 that Google Bol has also complained
00:09:39.760 about um now some of that might show up
00:09:42.920 here in in this particular report saying
00:09:45.640 like hey uh we can't reach your pce
00:09:47.560 because it's blocked but it's not the
00:09:49.120 only reason why might pop up here so
00:09:50.959 keep in mind it's not the final solution
00:09:53.240 or the final answer but it may give you
00:09:55.399 an indication now you do might know that
00:09:59.079 Google gole also publishes uh the IP
00:10:01.640 addresses that they crawl from right and
00:10:03.760 we can use those uh to Whit list great
00:10:06.800 Whit list however they are being updated
00:10:08.839 regularly so uh as a result you need to
00:10:12.040 make sure that the IT team updates them
00:10:13.760 regularly otherwise again you're
00:10:14.959 blocking and you need to do the moment
00:10:16.839 that they actually update it yeah that's
00:10:18.680 another thing but also if you do any log
00:10:21.959 parsing or compar and and Analysis later
00:10:25.800 on on log files from a year ago that
00:10:28.839 list May be updated and IP addresses may
00:10:30.959 have been removed because that happens
00:10:33.160 too and so now a log log entry from a
00:10:37.120 year ago you may not a be able to verify
00:10:39.560 because the IP address isn't being used
00:10:41.120 anymore unless you have historic data
00:10:43.320 for that IP address so you can use tools
00:10:46.120 like this now the better approach when
00:10:49.000 you do work with firewalls and an overly
00:10:51.480 aggressive it team uh on blocking Bots
00:10:55.480 uh first allow the Bots set a threshold
00:10:57.800 once you have a certain threshold verify
00:11:00.000 if you should block the bot like this
00:11:01.839 could be like a th000 qu requests an
00:11:04.399 hour or week or whatever yeah talk about
00:11:07.040 what is reasonable and at that point
00:11:08.959 block if needed but take a reactive
00:11:11.279 approach rather than a proactive
00:11:13.040 approach yeah now another topic on the
00:11:17.480 other side now we had talked about Bots
00:11:19.680 we also have the other side are you
00:11:21.279 human yeah and you may have seen these
00:11:23.680 type of screens where like hey are you a
00:11:25.800 human and Google has complained about
00:11:28.000 that too because they also cause a
00:11:29.959 problem for SEO for example they
00:11:31.600 generate these Infinite Space of URLs on
00:11:34.639 your domain especially when you use
00:11:36.880 services like Cloud flare because in
00:11:38.920 their situation they basically take over
00:11:41.240 your domain on name server level and
00:11:43.560 they just append it to the path and you
00:11:45.360 don't you don't have control at that
00:11:46.839 point now um also the responses that
00:11:50.200 we're giving may not be actually content
00:11:52.639 but there 200 status code so again
00:11:54.920 something that Google has complained
00:11:56.160 about if you use cloud F Services make
00:11:58.480 sure that you have this line on your
00:12:01.720 robot of txt even if you do not uh use
00:12:04.880 the challenge uh feature of like are you
00:12:07.000 a bot or not just have it because if one
00:12:09.600 of your organization in your
00:12:11.399 organization enables
00:12:13.360 it you want to have it there from day
00:12:15.959 one yeah so it's a simple line added if
00:12:18.680 you use cloud flare as a simple example
00:12:20.600 and they also say so please add this so
00:12:22.720 it's nothing too new but a lot of people
00:12:24.480 don't um if you use cloud storage also
00:12:27.360 fun fun thing uh to use cloud storage we
00:12:29.839 can for example use AWS uh as three
00:12:32.519 buckets here the first one is NASA uh
00:12:35.600 page if you look at the NASA page the
00:12:37.160 actual NASA page is also live on
00:12:40.199 nasa.gov and they're basically identical
00:12:42.639 D well they're basically duplicat the
00:12:44.880 the the thing is it's NASA they did not
00:12:47.000 add a
00:12:47.839 canonical yeah um yes that happens um
00:12:52.839 now but that's not the only place we Al
00:12:55.399 also can find these storage buckets for
00:12:56.959 example at Google no it's not limit or
00:12:59.760 digital spaces from digital Ocean or
00:13:01.959 whatever there's a whole bunch of these
00:13:03.360 type of Pockets out there where we have
00:13:05.240 duplicates of our content yeah uh low
00:13:08.720 balances is another example uh here two
00:13:11.079 examples of low balances um great right
00:13:14.240 on Google user content.com if you run
00:13:16.839 containerized apps or serverless apps
00:13:19.839 you may have it also for example if you
00:13:21.920 running Google Cloud on Google run you
00:13:24.279 may have a run. apppp
00:13:27.120 subdomain yeah and again with all your
00:13:29.839 stuff duplicated uh if you Outsource uh
00:13:32.880 here's a WP engine example I don't know
00:13:35.040 if you guys can see it but the top is
00:13:36.720 basically Pages all index alternate page
00:13:39.279 with proper uh canonical tag and the
00:13:41.880 bottom is the user declared is the root
00:13:45.320 domain what however is happening the
00:13:47.720 root domain is not being served as
00:13:49.560 primary instead the wp engine subdomain
00:13:52.720 is rendered as the primary despite the
00:13:54.759 root being mentioned also even in the
00:13:56.360 sitemap yeah cdns similar story can
00:14:00.320 happen there too here's MOS with most of
00:14:02.360 their Pages duplicated yes it also
00:14:04.480 happens to us seos yeah but no not the
00:14:07.320 only ones Master Class similar story
00:14:09.040 photo deck similar story if we look
00:14:10.880 there again 200 status codes on both SES
00:14:13.480 um if we also look at some of the bigger
00:14:15.639 guys gold Goldman sex similar story
00:14:18.759 duplicated even there we can find they
00:14:21.079 have a canonical in place still it's
00:14:23.199 indexed meaning chonicles don't always
00:14:25.560 work it's a suggestion you can't rely on
00:14:28.519 them yeah and especially with this type
00:14:30.920 of duplicate duplic content issue you
00:14:33.399 really cannot so keep that in mind now
00:14:37.160 one of those things also happened to me
00:14:38.920 obviously which is one of the reasons
00:14:40.279 why I made this deck in the first place
00:14:41.839 this happened to me in the last few
00:14:43.000 years a few times I do develop a lot of
00:14:45.240 apps and stuff like that I containerized
00:14:47.360 them normally I launch them in the cloud
00:14:49.480 I put them on Google run and I want
00:14:52.160 often also uh things to run fast so it
00:14:54.279 also a low balancer as well as CD use
00:14:56.959 the Google CDN Network
00:15:00.079 now with that I know I have to put up a
00:15:03.720 redirect straight off because if the
00:15:05.680 host name has that run. app thing I
00:15:08.199 wanted to redirect it to the main domain
00:15:10.399 yeah so I do that first so bum I put a
00:15:13.079 redirect on I detect the host name if it
00:15:15.240 contains uh run. app if it ends on that
00:15:17.839 then I redirected to the main domain
00:15:19.399 leave the path intact um so it's
00:15:21.800 basically Tre on deep redirect and I do
00:15:24.959 all the usual checks on my side
00:15:26.759 everything is fine yeah on my main
00:15:29.440 domain I check basic tools all the tools
00:15:32.279 you can think of J octopus deep Lumar or
00:15:35.600 enro or whatever you know screaming fog
00:15:37.880 it all works fine of course that things
00:15:40.120 to optimize but overall no alarm Bells
00:15:42.880 go off and then I got this email
00:15:47.240 500 and I get this really weird Euro and
00:15:51.079 I'll blow it out a little bit it's this
00:15:53.279 one really weird HP public AC 01 ac01 C
00:15:58.240 gcp e D3 Etc I'm like
00:16:02.120 wait yeah okay so I look a little bit
00:16:04.959 deeper I see gcp Google Cloud platform
00:16:09.000 reference then I see with with someone
00:16:11.680 else who has the same problem as me
00:16:13.160 doesn't know it uh they there I also see
00:16:15.839 a reference to open caching so I now
00:16:17.880 have to look into open caching and yes
00:16:19.319 there's a protocol open caching protocol
00:16:21.360 that distributes content to open cdns
00:16:24.839 like with ISP Etc so now I have to add
00:16:27.639 another line to my reader
00:16:30.319 now I know this works because after I do
00:16:32.880 I start getting email alerts that yeah
00:16:34.600 the link has been removed it's now a 301
00:16:37.240 great at least that worked so I'm
00:16:39.600 thinking okay I'm good right let's look
00:16:41.800 at the back links nope now I see there
00:16:45.360 Google user content.com popping up in my
00:16:48.040 backlinks in Google search console so
00:16:49.800 I'm like what's going on so yeah my
00:16:52.680 content is duplicated again somewhere
00:16:55.120 else on another on another subdomain and
00:16:58.040 I'm like seriously uh yeah so I have to
00:17:00.839 add that now too to my list um now think
00:17:04.400 that's it nope I know that is the IP oh
00:17:07.359 sorry that was the low balancer so if
00:17:09.240 you look here there's an IP address in
00:17:11.559 Reverse so I go to the IP address and
00:17:14.599 yep guess what my website is also
00:17:17.079 accessible there so again I have to add
00:17:19.160 another line to my redirects um you know
00:17:23.319 now then I'm like okay let's look into
00:17:25.559 what's going on so I go to the low
00:17:27.679 balancer website and then dive into the
00:17:29.679 sitemap what do I find the whole sitemap
00:17:31.919 the host names have been Rewritten from
00:17:33.440 my normal domain to guess what the load
00:17:35.880 balancer host name that's why Google's
00:17:38.760 indexing it all yeah so I'm like
00:17:41.039 seriously no so I try to fix it and
00:17:43.679 while I'm doing that I can get this
00:17:44.760 email from Yandex who says yeah your
00:17:46.799 canonical has changed to this weird
00:17:49.280 appspot.com thing I'm like seriously
00:17:52.440 what is going on yeah so it turns out if
00:17:55.039 you're on the same network uh Google
00:17:57.000 proxies and especially some of those
00:17:58.880 Russian ones uh they can basically
00:18:01.000 overtake the host name part within the
00:18:02.520 Google Cloud Network apparently I don't
00:18:04.720 know uh but somehow it reseted my my
00:18:08.000 canonical now so I'm not only canonical
00:18:10.799 are off the side mats are off my content
00:18:12.960 is being duplicated all over the place
00:18:14.520 I'm like seriously what's going on so I
00:18:17.559 haven't even talked about the fact that
00:18:18.799 I also still have to uh add the www by
00:18:22.039 the way so I try to basically look at
00:18:25.240 yes I had to add it too um basically
00:18:27.760 look at what's the cost so I launch my
00:18:30.000 app in Python with flash with workor and
00:18:33.240 I find out the URL 4 function tries to
00:18:36.280 detect the host name based on the
00:18:37.480 environmental settings normally that
00:18:39.880 works but in Cloud environments it's a
00:18:42.120 little bit trickier and if you think
00:18:43.559 this is just python no this all applies
00:18:45.799 to all those languages and this is just
00:18:47.520 a few few of them so this is not
00:18:50.120 isolated yeah it really depends on every
00:18:52.640 single one what they fill out with um so
00:18:55.440 yeah I'm I have this I need to add the
00:18:57.120 www as well I'm like this getting enough
00:18:59.760 I don't want to do exception after
00:19:01.799 exception exception so I do the other
00:19:03.640 way around I have to now hard code my
00:19:06.000 domain in my code to basically say if it
00:19:08.960 doesn't match that it must be one of the
00:19:10.880 other ones so then redirect yeah now
00:19:14.600 that's of course not great but now I
00:19:16.280 have to hard code domains uh which goes
00:19:18.720 a little bit against the whole
00:19:20.280 dockerized thing but yeah anyway um some
00:19:23.039 considerations if you have this type of
00:19:25.080 problem as well is you want to prevent
00:19:27.120 indexation of this dupli content of
00:19:29.120 course redirect when you can disallow
00:19:31.240 with robot txt if you can't be mindful
00:19:34.280 that you should actually always have a
00:19:36.120 robot at txt because not everyone does
00:19:38.640 for example here's um I'm just going to
00:19:41.320 go ahead if you want to test your robots
00:19:43.640 txt check also with Google but here's
00:19:45.480 the key thing so if you have a bucket if
00:19:48.120 you have your stuff in a bucket and you
00:19:49.840 do not have a robot of txt there you may
00:19:52.120 get something like a 4 or3 or 4 or4 as
00:19:55.159 for for the robots of txt file in your
00:19:57.600 Shain bucket
00:19:59.360 yeah that means crawl everything so if
00:20:01.960 your site has a robot at txt but does
00:20:03.840 not have that in the bucket but is
00:20:05.080 duplicated in the bucket so the things
00:20:07.480 that you have excluded on your domain
00:20:09.799 are now fully crawlable from your bucket
00:20:12.840 so the things you don't want to yeah so
00:20:14.600 be mindful keep in mind robot txd also
00:20:17.120 needs to be in that bucket now also uh
00:20:19.720 keep in mind inheritance because not
00:20:21.760 every bucket is on the subdomain meaning
00:20:24.559 in this case it's on the subdirectory so
00:20:27.080 I've seen people trying to block with
00:20:28.880 Robos txd in the sub but that doesn't
00:20:31.840 work yeah you do need uh it on the root
00:20:36.240 of the origin and in that case we're
00:20:38.320 back to the root of the origin that
00:20:40.000 Google controls which is a 44 crawl
00:20:43.760 everything not great Idol right so be
00:20:46.240 mindful there which type of bucket you
00:20:47.960 have um you also want to disable
00:20:50.200 directory listings because people you
00:20:52.320 know can go in there and there are these
00:20:54.360 grayhead tools that are trying to
00:20:55.840 basically expose every bucket that's out
00:20:57.520 there so not only search engines it's
00:20:59.480 also for security purposes disable these
00:21:01.559 things uh and utilize no index if all
00:21:03.600 the other things fail yeah but
00:21:05.919 specifically for the bucket of course
00:21:07.200 because you don't want know index your
00:21:08.320 website be mindful with canonical there
00:21:10.440 to not use it at the same time also one
00:21:12.799 other thing I don't ever almost see
00:21:15.159 anyone do is add their bucket or the CDN
00:21:18.480 um thing like cloudfront Etc to Google
00:21:21.640 search console you can add it as a uh
00:21:25.240 URL prefix and see what's going on there
00:21:28.200 yeah
00:21:29.120 um and set up alerts make sure you have
00:21:31.120 a bunch of alerts that alert you on
00:21:33.520 these things because this is off domain
00:21:35.679 so link alerts and 500 errors I every
00:21:39.039 every 500 error that's generated on any
00:21:41.240 of my websites I get an
00:21:43.000 email that's how I found it initially
00:21:46.080 yeah so these things yes I got hundreds
00:21:48.159 of emails but that's a different
00:21:50.279 problem that is a problem I can solve
00:21:52.919 and I I rather know about it than not
00:21:54.919 know about it you know what I mean so
00:21:56.559 this is one of those things and it
00:21:58.559 depend on your text what you can and
00:21:59.880 cannot do but by all means use all of
00:22:01.840 these link detection things and whatever
00:22:03.880 alerts to to basically see what you uh
00:22:07.480 can do there and now just a quick bonus
00:22:10.279 to add because I do like also processing
00:22:13.320 backhands and I think we can do better
00:22:15.520 there and Rick talked about a little bit
00:22:17.919 but uh the key thing is we want to speed
00:22:21.279 websites up and for that reason we want
00:22:24.120 to make sure that our network is fast so
00:22:26.240 we can look at se console and we can see
00:22:27.799 for example this is not stable yeah this
00:22:30.880 is not a stable connection um we also
00:22:33.600 want to reduce latency which is one of
00:22:35.000 the reasons why I launch most of my apps
00:22:36.720 in Google Cloud because it's closer to
00:22:38.520 Google
00:22:39.320 bot another reason to put it there yeah
00:22:42.679 um time to First buite Rick talked about
00:22:45.159 this morning most definitely something
00:22:46.840 in case you're wondering this is too
00:22:48.159 slow yeah this is better so uh just FYI
00:22:52.760 um if you are going serverless also keep
00:22:55.400 in mind that you want to look at the
00:22:57.559 instances you running
00:22:59.000 and because starting up a new instance
00:23:00.760 is a cold start and even if you have a
00:23:03.080 fast boot uh it takes time now and just
00:23:06.840 as an example I have here bilding like a
00:23:09.799 instance running minimum instance
00:23:11.880 running and being built for that I turn
00:23:13.760 that off and basically did on user
00:23:16.159 request it killed my time to first bite
00:23:19.960 at the end there yeah it just took more
00:23:23.039 time to boot up all the time so you
00:23:25.400 always need to have one running minimum
00:23:27.320 if not two yeah um also make sure you
00:23:30.159 use the latest security things like TLS
00:23:32.960 htps uh because they allow you to do
00:23:34.960 some fun stuff with the network I'm not
00:23:36.559 going to go into detail of that I'm sure
00:23:38.120 that you guys can read the documentation
00:23:39.919 be mindful though when you are using
00:23:42.960 compressions um that um uh you use also
00:23:47.320 the same one as your CDN uh because I
00:23:49.960 have seen and I've also experienced even
00:23:51.919 firsthand issues where I was using
00:23:54.159 broadly but CDN couldn't support broadly
00:23:56.600 they only use gzip so now uh there was a
00:23:59.000 mismatch in encoding and that actually
00:24:01.200 was uh causing rendering issues in the
00:24:03.559 browser yeah so be mindful there too uh
00:24:06.840 server resources we're talking here
00:24:08.200 about CPU RAM and disk this is something
00:24:10.400 you really want to optimize as well and
00:24:11.919 go a little bit more than you need to
00:24:13.279 here's an example where I basically uh
00:24:15.919 went to the next level in the standard
00:24:17.880 lifts and it made a huge difference just
00:24:20.159 making that switch that's it nothing
00:24:22.200 more yeah um make sure you have enough
00:24:24.960 resources now of course all of this time
00:24:26.919 to First buy Rick talked about morning a
00:24:29.000 lot of this stuff uh can improve the
00:24:31.000 other web vitals too but I also like to
00:24:32.919 look at from the other direction with
00:24:34.360 web vitals and to look at which websites
00:24:36.880 are fast and how are their we basically
00:24:40.120 based on the web vitals which websites
00:24:42.960 have good web vitals and which
00:24:44.600 Technologies are they then using yeah so
00:24:47.240 the other way around and um the Crux
00:24:50.480 team have a report I heard from Rick
00:24:52.640 this morning they are bettering or they
00:24:54.840 are working on the better with a new
00:24:57.120 interface so new stuff com up um but key
00:25:00.760 thing here uh when we look for example
00:25:03.200 at server software um here's the
00:25:05.480 operating systems we can see Debian and
00:25:07.760 FreeBSD doing a lot better ubun does not
00:25:10.399 windows in the middle no big surprise
00:25:12.159 there um but yeah the the you know this
00:25:14.919 can be a consideration when you are
00:25:16.840 considering changing your TX stack yeah
00:25:19.240 you can look at these things is this
00:25:21.039 something that might be better for us uh
00:25:23.120 same when it comes to the type of server
00:25:25.320 uh the HTTP servers it's all over the
00:25:26.960 place but if few jump out and some also
00:25:29.080 in the negative way so maybe that's
00:25:30.760 something to consider um also where you
00:25:33.279 want to identify other bottlenecks like
00:25:35.080 for example the distance to the user of
00:25:37.200 course which cloud provider do you use
00:25:40.159 again there's a whole bunch of them if
00:25:42.120 you take the top known ones here uh we
00:25:45.080 can see two really jump out and nether
00:25:47.880 one or AWS or Zuri yeah and yeah that
00:25:52.200 might be because of that may also not be
00:25:54.200 might be other reasons but this is a
00:25:55.799 consideration this is something to keep
00:25:57.279 in mind when you using the next time uh
00:26:00.000 which language you program your website
00:26:01.559 is python is most definitely not the
00:26:03.520 fastest it's the easiest not the fastest
00:26:06.000 everyone faster may want to use another
00:26:07.760 one yeah and we can also see again which
00:26:11.880 uh sites are faster we're using which
00:26:14.120 language that this is of course assuming
00:26:16.000 that uh this is all correctly detected
00:26:18.279 it's from a sample data set yeah keep
00:26:20.279 that in mind and when we use inmemory or
00:26:23.080 disc caching is also a technique that we
00:26:24.960 can use in the back end really well and
00:26:27.240 here's an example of one of my websites
00:26:29.360 where I implemented it from not to
00:26:31.200 implementing both of them at the same
00:26:33.159 time and it made a huge
00:26:35.159 difference um keep that in mind when
00:26:37.880 we're talking about cashable resources
00:26:40.440 every page should be cashable one of the
00:26:42.520 biggest mistakes that I see uh website
00:26:45.000 owners do is use a CDN and then use a
00:26:48.240 cash control of no store which
00:26:51.159 completely defeats the purpose of using
00:26:52.799 a CDN yeah because every request has to
00:26:55.440 still go to the origin so make sure all
00:26:57.880 your resources are cashable and if
00:26:59.360 they're cashable that also means that
00:27:00.840 you can do a lot more with SEO in the
00:27:02.799 right way so that's cool so by all means
00:27:05.559 you can also even have your own Edge
00:27:07.440 server it does not need to be a known
00:27:09.760 CDN uh if you look here for example it's
00:27:12.480 all over the place so let's take the top
00:27:13.919 three and then we can see Farish Farish
00:27:17.080 your own implementation yeah can be just
00:27:19.919 as fast as any of those Cloud Solutions
00:27:22.919 yeah keep that in mind when we have a
00:27:25.000 database um again might better it might
00:27:29.520 be consideration to see which database
00:27:31.760 is faster for you now keep in mind
00:27:34.600 doesn't stop there we also need to look
00:27:36.039 at the latency of our queries for
00:27:38.399 example are we executing uh complex
00:27:41.320 queries like joints Etc uh what type of
00:27:45.000 data format do we have how do we store
00:27:46.600 the data SQL no SQL you know all of this
00:27:49.399 kind of stuff how many queries do we
00:27:50.960 need to send here's a simple hello world
00:27:53.799 installation on WordPress 18 queries
00:27:56.720 through the database hello world 18
00:27:58.880 queries well though 2,000 plus hooks
00:28:01.919 what really I can do a static side
00:28:05.080 that's faster than that come on why do
00:28:07.080 we need this well it's because of these
00:28:08.600 type of things in the template most of
00:28:10.919 this stuff is static it never changes it
00:28:13.440 changes on day one and that's it why
00:28:15.559 don't we make these Global variables
00:28:17.080 instead yeah save all of those database
00:28:19.159 queries simple things like that um when
00:28:21.640 you have assets uh a lot of people say
00:28:23.880 like yeah just Rend them from a bucket
00:28:26.240 that has its advantages um we can use
00:28:28.840 maybe a bucket but I'm not ecstatic
00:28:31.240 about it I haven't seen many websites
00:28:33.240 that actually perform well with that and
00:28:35.000 this also tells me nothing pretty much
00:28:37.279 almost nothing gets about 40% here so
00:28:40.039 with some exceptions at some points I'm
00:28:43.640 not really excitic about that option you
00:28:45.880 need to test what works for you now of
00:28:47.480 course you can use the server header
00:28:50.000 server timing to record these things in
00:28:52.519 the back end and send that along with
00:28:54.600 the HTTP request or response basically
00:28:57.000 to this uh uh user and grab it with your
00:28:59.799 analytics and basically grab this data
00:29:02.279 and you can see what is really the
00:29:03.960 bottleneck in the back of your uh back
00:29:06.200 end now where you do that and you fix
00:29:09.159 those things you will see your call
00:29:10.720 requests go up because that's what
00:29:12.159 Google wants to see as well yeah they
00:29:14.120 will crawl your website more now uh
00:29:16.640 quick takeaways um content quality
00:29:19.440 issues we have a lot of them especially
00:29:21.559 in the cloud um we need to audit this
00:29:23.840 regularly and keep in mind don't limit
00:29:26.679 your ERS to just the domain
00:29:28.880 check outside that especially when there
00:29:30.600 are things happening like low balances
00:29:33.399 CDN and whatever uh tackle these issues
00:29:35.880 then find a solution for it um avoid the
00:29:38.519 duplication and optimize the back end
00:29:40.799 please yeah no one wants to be in this
00:29:42.919 situation so uh my name is Philly I'm an
